<h2><a id="Zut"></a>Zut</h2>

<p class="dropcap">SIDE by side, on the avenue de la Grande
Armée, stand the épicerie of Jean-Baptiste
Caille and the salle de coiffure of Hippolyte
Sergeot, and between these two there
is a great gulf fixed, the which has come to be
through the acerbity of Alexandrine Caille
(according to Espérance Sergeot), through the
duplicity of Espérance Sergeot (according to
Alexandrine Caille). But the veritable root of
all evil is Zut, and Zut sits smiling in Jean-Baptiste's
doorway, and cares naught for anything
in the world, save the sunlight and her
midday meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>

When Hippolyte found himself in a position
to purchase the salle de coiffure, he gave evidence
of marked acumen by uniting himself in
the holy&mdash;and civil&mdash;bonds of matrimony with
the retiring patron's daughter, whose dot ran
into the coveted five figures, and whose heart,
said Hippolyte, was as good as her face was
pretty, which, even by the unprejudiced, was
acknowledged to be forcible commendation.
The installation of the new establishment was
a nine days' wonder in the quartier. It is a
busy thoroughfare at its western end, is the
avenue de la Grande Armée, crowded with bicyclists
and with a multitude of creatures fearfully
and wonderfully clad, who do incomprehensible
things in connection with motor-carriages.
Also there are big cafés in plenty, whose
waiters must be smoothly shaven: and moreover,
at the time when Hippolyte came into his
own, the porte Maillot station of the Métropolitain
had already pushed its entrée and sortie
up through the soil, not a hundred metres from
his door, where they stood like atrocious yellow
tulips, art nouveau, breathing people out and in
by thousands. There was no lack of possible
custom. The problem was to turn possible into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>probable, and probable into permanent; and
here the seven wits and the ten thousand
francs of Espérance came prominently to the
fore. She it was who sounded the progressive
note, which is half the secret of success.</p>

<p>"Pour attirer les gens," she said, with her
arms akimbo, "il faut d'abord les épater."</p>

<p>In her creed all that was worth doing at all
was worth doing gloriously. So, under her
guidance, Hippolyte journeyed from shop to
shop in the faubourg St. Antoine, and spent
hours of impassioned argument with carpenters
and decorators. In the end, the salle de
coiffure was glorified by fresh paint without and
within, and by the addition of a long mirror in
a gilt frame, and a complicated apparatus of
gleaming nickel-plate, which went by the imposing
title of appareil antiseptique, and the
acquisition of which was duly proclaimed by a
special placard that swung at right angles to
the door. The shop was rechristened, too, and
the black and white sign across its front which
formerly bore the simple inscription "Kilbert,
Coiffeur," now blazoned abroad the vastly
more impressive legend "Salon Malakoff."
The window shelves fairly groaned beneath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>their burden of soaps, toilet waters, and perfumery,
a string of bright yellow sponges occupied
each corner of the window, and, through
the agency of white enamel letters on the pane
itself, public attention was drawn to the apparently
contradictory facts that English was spoken
and "schampoing" given within. Then
Hippolyte engaged two assistants, and clad
them in white duck jackets, and his wife fabricated
a new blouse of blue silk, and seated
herself behind the desk with an engaging smile.
The enterprise was fairly launched, and experience
was not slow in proving the theories of
Espérance to be well founded. The quartier
was épaté from the start, and took with enthusiasm
the bait held forth. The affairs of the
Salon Malakoff prospered prodigiously.</p>

<p>But there is a serpent in every Eden, and
in that of the Sergeot this rôle was assumed
by Alexandrine Caille. The worthy épicier
himself was of too torpid a temperament to
fall a victim to the gnawing tooth of envy, but
in the soul of his wife the launch, and, what
was worse, the immediate prosperity of the
Salon Malakoff, bred dire resentment. Her
own establishment had grown grimy with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>passage of time, and the annual profits displayed
a constant and disturbing tendency
toward complete evaporation, since the coming
of the big cafés, and the resultant subversion
of custom to the wholesale dealers. This
persistent narrowing of the former appreciable
gap between purchase and selling price rankled
in Alexandrine's mind, but her misguided
efforts to maintain the percentage of profit by
recourse to inferior qualities only made bad
worse, and, even as the Sergeot were steering
the Salon Malakoff forth upon the waters of
prosperity, there were nightly conferences in
the household next door, at which impending
ruin presided, and exasperation sounded the
keynote of every sentence. The resplendent
façade of Hippolyte's establishment, the tide
of custom which poured into and out of his
door, the loudly expressed admiration of his
ability and thrift, which greeted her ears on
every side, and, finally, the sight of Espérance,
fresh, smiling, and prosperous, behind her little
counter,&mdash;all these were as gall and wormwood
to Alexandrine, brooding over her accumulating
debts and her decreasing earnings,
among her dusty stacks of jars and boxes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>Once she had called upon her neighbor, somewhat
for courtesy's sake, but more for curiosity's,
and since then the agreeable scent of
violet and lilac perfumery dwelt always in her
memory, and mirages of scrupulously polished
nickel and glass hung always before her eyes.
The air of her own shop was heavy with the
pungent odors of raw vegetables, cheeses, and
dried fish, and no brilliance redeemed the
sardine and biscuit boxes which surrounded
her. Life became a bitter thing to Alexandrine
Caille, for if nothing is more gratifying
than one's own success, surely nothing is less
so than that of one's neighbor. Moreover, her
visit had never been returned, and this again
was fuel for her rage.</p>

<p>But the sharpest thorn in her flesh&mdash;and
even in that of her phlegmatic husband&mdash;was
the base desertion to the enemy's camp of
Abel Flique. In the days when Madame
Caille was unmarried, and when her ninety
kilos were fifty still, Abel had been youngest
commis in the very shop over which she now
held sway, and the most devoted suitor in all
her train. Even after his prowess in the black
days of '71 had won him the attention of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>civil authorities, and a grateful municipality
had transformed the grocer-soldier into a guardian
of law and order, he still hung upon the
favor of his heart's first love, and only gave up
the struggle when Jean-Baptiste bore off the
prize and enthroned her in state as presiding
genius of his newly acquired épicerie. Later, an
unwittingly kindly prefect had transferred Abel
to the seventeenth arrondissement, and so the
old friendship was picked up where it had been
dropped, and the ruddy-faced agent found it
both convenient and agreeable to drop in frequently
at Madame Caille's on his way home,
and exchange a few words of reminiscence or
banter for a box of sardines or a minute package
of tea. But, with the deterioration in his
old friends' wares, and the almost simultaneous
appearance of the Salon Malakoff, his
loyalty wavered. Flique sampled the advantages
of Hippolyte's establishment, and, being
won over thereby, returned again and again.
His hearty laugh came to be heard almost
daily in the salle de coiffure, and because he
was a brave homme and a good customer, who
did not stand upon a question of a few sous,
but allowed Hippolyte to work his will, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>trim and curl and perfume him to his heart's
content, there was always a welcome for him,
and a smile from Madame Sergeot, and occasionally
a little present of brillantine or perfumery,
for friendship's sake, and because it
is well to have the good-will of the all-powerful
police.</p>

<p>From her window Madame Caille observed
the comings and goings of Abel with a resentful
eye. It was rarely now that he glanced
into the épicerie as he passed, and still more
rarely that he greeted his former flame with a
stiff nod. Once she had hailed him from the
doorway, sardines in hand, but he had replied
that he was pressed for time, and had passed
rapidly on. Then indeed did blackness descend
upon the soul of Alexandrine, and in
her deepest consciousness she vowed to have
revenge. Neither the occasion nor the method
was as yet clear to her, but she pursed her lips
ominously, and bided her time.</p>

<p>In the existence of Madame Caille there was
one emphatic consolation for all misfortunes,
the which was none other than Zut, a white
angora cat of surpassing beauty and prodigious
size. She had come into Alexandrine's possession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>as a kitten, and, what with much eating
and an inherent distaste for exercise, had attained
her present proportions and her superb
air of unconcern. It was from the latter that
she derived her name, the which, in Parisian
argot, at once means everything and nothing,
but is chiefly taken to signify complete and
magnificent indifference to all things mundane
and material: and in the matter of indifference
Zut was past-mistress. Even for Madame
Caille herself, who fed her with the choicest
morsels from her own plate, brushed her fine
fur with excessive care, and addressed caressing
remarks to her at minute intervals throughout
the day, Zut manifested a lack of interest
that amounted to contempt. As she basked in
the warm sun at the shop door, the round face
of her mistress beamed upon her from the little
desk, and the voice of her mistress sent fulsome
flattery winging toward her on the heavy
air. Was she beautiful, mon Dieu! In effect,
all that one could dream of the most beautiful!
And her eyes, of a blue like the heaven,
were they not wise and calm? Mon Dieu,
yes! It was a cat among thousands, a mimi
almost divine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>

Jean-Baptiste, appealed to for confirmation
of these statements, replied that it was so.
There was no denying that this was a magnificent
beast. And of a chic. And caressing&mdash;(which
was exaggeration). And of an affection&mdash;(which
was doubtful). And courageous&mdash;(which
was wholly untrue.) Mazette, yes!
A cat of cats! And was the boy to be the
whole afternoon in delivering a cheese, he demanded
of her? And Madame Caille would
challenge him to ask her that&mdash;but it was a
good, great beast all the same!&mdash;and so bury
herself again in her accounts, until her attention
was once more drawn to Zut, and fresh
flattery poured forth. For all of this Zut cared
less than nothing. In the midst of her mistress's
sweetest cajolery, she simply closed her
sapphire eyes, with an inexpressibly eloquent
air of weariness, or turned to the intricacies of
her toilet, as who should say: "Continue. I
am listening. But it is unimportant."</p>

<p>But long familiarity with her disdain had
deprived it of any sting, so far as Alexandrine
was concerned. Passive indifference she could
suffer. It was only when Zut proceeded to
an active manifestation of ingratitude that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>inflicted an irremediable wound. Returning
from her marketing one morning, Madame
Caille discovered her graceless favorite seated
complacently in the doorway of the Salon
Malakoff, and, in a paroxysm of indignation,
bore down upon her, and snatched her to her
breast.</p>

<p>"Unhappy one!" she cried, planting herself
in full view of Espérance, and, while raining
the letter of her reproach upon the truant,
contriving to apply its spirit wholly to her
neighbor. "What hast thou done? Is it that
thou desertest me for strangers, who may destroy
thee? Name of a name, hast thou no
heart? They would steal thee from me&mdash;and
above all, <em>now</em>! Well then, no! One shall
see if such things are permitted! Vagabond!"
And with this parting shot, which
passed harmlessly over the head of the offender,
and launched itself full at Madame Sergeot,
the outraged épicière flounced back into
her own domain, where, turning, she threatened
the empty air with a passionate gesture.</p>

<p>"Vagabond!" she repeated. "Good-for-nothing!
Is it not enough to have robbed me
of my friends, that you must steal my child as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>well? We shall see!"&mdash;then, suddenly softening&mdash;"Thou
art beautiful, and good, and wise.
Mon Dieu, if I should lose thee, and above all,
<em>now</em>!"</p>

<p>Now there existed a marked, if unvoiced,
community of feeling between Espérance and
her resentful neighbor, for the former's passion
for cats was more consuming even than the
latter's. She had long cherished the dream of
possessing a white angora, and when, that morning,
of her own accord, Zut stepped into the
Salon Malakoff, she was received with demonstrations
even warmer than those to which she
had long since become accustomed. And,
whether it was the novelty of her surroundings,
or merely some unwonted instinct which made
her unusually susceptible, her habitual indifference
then and there gave place to animation,
and her satisfaction was vented in her long,
appreciative purr, wherewith it was not once
a year that she vouchsafed to gladden her
owner's heart. Espérance hastened to prepare
a saucer of milk, and, when this was exhausted,
added a generous portion of fish, and Zut then
made a tour of the shop, rubbing herself against
the chair-legs, and receiving the homage of customers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>and duck-clad assistants alike. Flique,
his ruddy face screwed into a mere knot of
features, as Hippolyte worked violet hair-tonic
into his brittle locks, was moved to satire by
the apparition.</p>

<p>"Tiens! It is with the cat as with the
clients. All the world forsakes the Caille."</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the wrathful words of
Alexandrine, as she snatched her darling from
the doorway, awoke in the mind of Espérance
her first suspicion of this smouldering resentment.
Absorbed in the launching of her husband's
affairs, and constantly employed in the
making of change and with the keeping of her
simple accounts, she had had no time to bestow
upon her neighbors, and, even had her attention
been free, she could hardly have been expected
to deduce the rancor of Madame Caille
from the evidence at hand. But even if she
had been able to ignore the significance of that
furious outburst at her very door, its meaning
had not been lost upon the others, and her own
half-formed conviction was speedily confirmed.</p>

<p>"What has she?" cried Hippolyte, pausing
in the final stage of his operations upon the
highly perfumed Flique.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>"Do I know?" replied his wife with a shrug.
"She thinks I stole her cat&mdash;<em>I!</em>"</p>

<p>"Quite simply, she hates you," put in Flique.
"And why not? She is old, and fat, and her
business is taking itself off, like that! You
are young and"&mdash;with a bow, as he rose&mdash;"beautiful,
and your affairs march to a marvel.
She is jealous, c'est tout! It is a bad
character, that."</p>

<p>"But, mon Dieu!"&mdash;</p>

<p>"But what does that say to you? Let her
go her way, she and her cat. Au r'voir, 'sieurs,
'dame."</p>

<p>And, rattling a couple of sous into the little
urn reserved for tips, the policeman took his
departure, amid a chorus of "Merci, m'sieu',
au r'voir, m'sieu'," from Hippolyte and his
duck-clad aids.</p>

<p>But what he had said remained behind. All
day Madame Sergeot pondered upon the incident
of the morning and Abel Flique's comments
thereupon, seeking out some more plausible
reason for this hitherto unsuspected enmity
than the mere contrast between her material
conditions and those of Madame Caille seemed
to her to afford. For, to a natural placidity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>temperament, which manifested itself in a reluctance
to incur the displeasure of any one,
had been lately added in Espérance a shrewd
commercial instinct, which told her that the
fortunes of the Salon Malakoff might readily
be imperiled by an unfriendly tongue. In the
quartier, gossip spread quickly and took deep
root. It was quite imaginably within the power
of Madame Caille to circulate such rumors of
Sergeot dishonesty as should draw their lately
won custom from them and leave but empty
chairs and discontent where now all was prosperity
and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came to her the memory of
that visit which she had never returned. Mon
Dieu! and was not that reason enough? She,
the youngest patronne in the quartier, to ignore
deliberately the friendly call of a neighbor!
At least it was not too late to make amends.
So, when business lagged a little in the late
afternoon, Madame Sergeot slipped from her
desk, and, after a furtive touch to her hair,
went in next door to pour oil upon the troubled
waters.</p>

<p>Madame Caille, throned at her counter, received
her visitor with unexampled frigidity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>

"Ah, it is you," she said. "You have come
to make some purchases, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Eggs, madame," answered her visitor, disconcerted,
but tactfully accepting the hint.</p>

<p>"The best quality&mdash;or&mdash;?" demanded
Alexandrine, with the suggestion of a sneer.</p>

<p>"The best, evidently, madame. Six, if you
please. Spring weather at last, it would
seem."</p>

<p>To this generality the other made no reply.
Descending from her stool, she blew sharply
into a small paper bag, thereby distending it
into a miniature balloon, and began selecting
the eggs from a basket, holding each one
to the light, and then dusting it with exaggerated
care before placing it in the bag. While
she was thus employed Zut advanced from a
secluded corner, and, stretching her fore legs
slowly to their utmost length, greeted her acquaintance
of the morning with a yawn. Finding
in the cat an outlet for her embarrassment,
Espérance made another effort to give the
interview a friendly turn.</p>

<p>"He is beautiful, madame, your matou," she
said.</p>

<p>"It is a female," replied Madame Caille,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>turning abruptly from the basket, "and she
does not care for strangers."</p>

<p>This second snub was not calculated to encourage
neighborly overtures, but Madame Sergeot
had felt herself to be in the wrong, and
was not to be so readily repulsed.</p>

<p>"We do not see Monsieur Caille at the
Salon Malakoff," she continued. "We should
be enchanted"&mdash;</p>

<p>"My husband shaves himself," retorted Alexandrine,
with renewed dignity.</p>

<p>"But his hair"&mdash;ventured Espérance.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> cut it!" thundered her foe.</p>

<p>Here Madame Sergeot made a false move.
She laughed. Then, in confusion, and striving,
too late, to retrieve herself&mdash;"Pardon,
madame," she added, "but it seems droll to
me, that. After all, ten sous is a sum so
small"&mdash;</p>

<p>"All the world, unfortunately," broke in
Madame Caille, "has not the wherewithal to
buy mirrors, and pay itself frescoes and appareils
antiseptiques! The eggs are twenty-four
sous&mdash;but we do not pride ourselves upon our
eggs. Perhaps you had better seek them elsewhere
for the future!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>

For sole reply Madame Sergeot had recourse
to her expressive shrug, and then laying two
francs upon the counter, and gathering up the
sous which Alexandrine rather hurled at than
handed her, she took her way toward the door
with all the dignity at her command. But
Madame Caille, feeling her snub to have been
insufficient, could not let her go without a
final thrust.</p>

<p>"Perhaps your husband will be so amiable
as to shampoo my cat!" she shouted. "She
seems to like your 'Salon'!"</p>

<p>But Espérance, while for concord's sake
inclined to tolerate all rudeness to herself, was
not prepared to hear Hippolyte insulted, and
so, wheeling at the doorway, flung all her resentment
into two words.</p>

<p>"Mal élevée!"</p>

<p>"Gueuse!" screamed Alexandrine from the
desk. And so they parted.</p>

<p>Now, even at this stage, an armed truce
might still have been preserved, had Zut been
content with the evil she had wrought, and
not thought it incumbent upon her further to
embitter a quarrel that was a very pretty quarrel
as it stood. But, whether it was that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>milk and fish of the Salon Malakoff lay sweeter
upon her memory than any of the familiar
dainties of the épicerie Caille, or that, by her
unknowable feline instinct, she was irresistibly
drawn toward the scent of violet and lilac
brillantine, her first visit to the Sergeot was
soon repeated, and from this visit other visits
grew, until it was almost a daily occurrence
for her to saunter slowly into the salle de
coiffure, and there receive the food and homage
which were rendered as her undisputed
due. For, whatever was the bitterness of Espérance
toward Madame Caille, no part thereof
descended upon Zut. On the contrary, at each
visit her heart was more drawn toward the
sleek angora, and her desire but strengthened
to possess her peer. But white angoras are a
luxury, and an expensive one at that, and, however
prosperous the Salon Malakoff might be,
its proprietors were not as yet in a position to
squander eighty francs upon a whim. So, until
profits should mount higher, Madame Sergeot
was forced to content herself with the voluntary
visits of her neighbor's pet.</p>

<p>Madame Caille did not yield her rights of
sovereignty without a struggle. On the occasion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>of Zut's third visit, she descended upon
the Salon Malakoff, robed in wrath, and found
the adored one contentedly feeding on fish in
the very bosom of the family Sergeot. An
appalling scene ensued.</p>

<p>"If," she stormed, crimson of countenance,
and threatening Espérance with her fist, "if
you <em>must</em> entice my cat from her home, at <em>least</em>
I will thank you not to give her food. I provide
all that is necessary; and, for the rest,
how do I know what is in that saucer?"</p>

<p>And she surveyed the duck-clad assistants
and the astounded customers with tremendous
scorn.</p>

<p>"You others," she added, "I ask you, is it
just? These people take my cat, and feed her&mdash;<em>feed</em>
her&mdash;with I know not what! It is overwhelming,
unheard of&mdash;and, above all, <em>now</em>!"</p>

<p>But here the peaceful Hippolyte played
trumps.</p>

<p>"It is the privilege of the vulgar," he cried,
advancing, razor in hand, "when they are at
home, to insult their neighbors, but here&mdash;no!
My wife has told me of you and of your sayings.
Beware! or I shall arrange your affair
for you! Go! you and your cat!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>

And, by way of emphasis, he fairly kicked
Zut into her astonished owner's arms. He was
magnificent, was Hippolyte!</p>

<p>This anecdote, duly elaborated, was poured
into the ears of Abel Flique an hour later, and
that evening he paid his first visit in many
months to Madame Caille. She greeted him
effusively, being willing to pardon all the past
for the sake of regaining this powerful friend.
But the glitter in the agent's eye would have
cowed a fiercer spirit than hers.</p>

<p>"You amuse yourself," he said sternly, looking
straight at her over the handful of raisins
which she tendered him, "by wearying my
friends. I counsel you to take care. One
does not sell inferior eggs in Paris without
hearing of it sooner or later. I know more
than I have told, but not more than I <em>can</em> tell,
if I choose."</p>

<p>"Our ancient friendship"&mdash;faltered Alexandrine,
touched in a vulnerable spot.</p>

<p>"&mdash;preserves you thus far," added Flique,
no less unmoved. "Beware how you abuse
it!"</p>

<p>And so the calls of Zut were no longer disturbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>

But the rover spirit is progressive, and thus
short visits became long visits, and finally the
angora spent whole nights in the Salon Malakoff,
where a box and a bit of carpet were provided
for her. And one fateful morning the
meaning of Madame Caille's significant words
"and above all, <em>now</em>!" was made clear.</p>

<p>The prosperity of Hippolyte's establishment
had grown apace, so that, on the morning in
question, the three chairs were occupied, and
yet other customers awaited their turn. The
air was laden with violet and lilac. A stout
chauffeur, in a leather suit, thickly coated with
dust, was undergoing a shampoo at the hands
of one of the duck-clad, and, under the skillfully
plied razor of the other, the virgin down
slid from the lips and chin of a slim and somewhat
startled youth, while from a vaporizer
Hippolyte played a fine spray of perfumed
water upon the ruddy countenance of Abel
Flique. It was an eloquent moment, eminently
fitted for some dramatic incident, and
that dramatic incident Zut supplied. She advanced
slowly and with an air of conscious
dignity from the corner where was her carpeted
box, and in her mouth was a limp something,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>which, when deposited in the immediate centre
of the Salon Malakoff, resolved itself into an
angora kitten, as white as snow!</p>

<p>"Epatant!" said Flique, mopping his perfumed
chin. And so it was.</p>

<p>There was an immediate investigation of
Zut's quarters, which revealed four other
kittens, but each of these was marked with
black or tan. It was the flower of the flock
with which the proud mother had won her
public.</p>

<p>"And they are all yours!" cried Flique,
when the question of ownership arose. "Mon
Dieu, yes! There was such a case not a month
ago, in the eighth arrondissement&mdash;a concierge
of the avenue Hoche who made a contrary
claim. But the courts decided against
her. They are all yours, Madame Sergeot.
My felicitations!"</p>

<p>Now, as we have said, Madame Sergeot was
of a placid temperament which sought not
strife. But the unprovoked insults of Madame
Caille had struck deep, and, after all, she was
but human.</p>

<p>So it was that, seated at her little desk, she
composed the following masterpiece of satire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>

<span class="smcap">Chère Madame</span>,&mdash;We send you back your
cat, and the others&mdash;all but one. One kitten
was of a pure white, more beautiful even than
its mother. As we have long desired a white
angora, we keep this one as a souvenir of you.
We regret that we do not see the means of
accepting the kind offer you were so amiable
as to make us. We fear that we shall not find
time to shampoo your cat, as we shall be so
busy taking care of our own. Monsieur Flique
will explain the rest.</p>

<p>We pray you to accept, madame, the assurance
of our distinguished consideration,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hippolyte and Espérance Sergeot.</span></p></blockquote>

<p class="p2">It was Abel Flique who conveyed the above
epistle, and Zut, and four of Zut's kittens, to
Alexandrine Caille, and, when that wrathful
person would have rent him with tooth and
nail, it was Abel Flique who laid his finger on
his lip, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Concern yourself with the superior kitten,
madame, and I concern myself with the inferior
eggs!"</p>

<p>To which Alexandrine made no reply. After
Flique had taken his departure, she remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>speechless for five consecutive minutes for the
first time in the whole of her waking existence,
gazing at the spot at her feet where sprawled
the white angora, surrounded by her mottled
offspring. Even when the first shock of her
defeat had passed, she simply heaved a deep
sigh, and uttered two words,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>Zut</em>!"</p>

<p>The which, in Parisian argot, at once means
everything and nothing.</p>

<h2><a id="Caffiard"></a>Caffiard<br />

<small>DEUS EX MACHINA</small></h2>

<p class="dropcap">THE studio was tucked away in the extreme
upper northeast corner of 13 ter
rue Visconti, higher even than that cinquième,
dearly beloved of the impecunious,
and of whoso, between stairs and street odors,
chooses the lesser evil, and is more careful of
lungs than legs. After the six long flights had
been achieved, around a sharp corner and up
a little winding stairway, was the door which
bore the name of Pierre Vauquelin. Inside,
after stumbling along a narrow hall, as black
as Erebus, and floundering through a curtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>doorway, one came abruptly into the studio,
and, in all probability, fell headlong over a
little rattan stool, or an easel, or a box of
paints, and was picked up by the host, and
dusted, and put to rights, and made much of,
like a bumped child. Thus restored to equanimity
one was better able to appreciate what
Pierre called la Boîte.</p>

<p>The Box was a room eight metres in width
by ten in length, with a skylight above, and a
great, square window in the north wall, which
latter sloped inward from floor to ceiling, by
reason of the mansarde roof. Of what might
be called furniture there was but little, a Norman
cupboard of black wood, heavily carved,
a long divan, contrived from various packing
boxes and well-worn rugs, a large, square table,
a half dozen chairs, three easels, and a repulsive
little stove with an interminable pipe,
which, with its many twists and turns, gave
one the impression of a thick, black snake,
that had, a moment before, been swaying about
in the room, and had suddenly found a hole in
the roof through which to thrust its head.</p>

<p>But of minor things the Box was full to overflowing.
The Norman cupboard was crammed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>with an assortment of crockery, much of it
sadly nicked and cracked, the divan was strewn
with boxes of broken pastels, paint-brushes,
and palettes coated with dried colors, the table
littered with papers, sketches, and books, and
every chair had its own particular trap for the
unwary, in the form of thumb-tacks or a glass
half full of cloudy water: and in the midst of
this chaos, late on a certain mid-May afternoon,
stood the painter himself, with his hands
thrust deep into the pockets of his corduroy
trousers, and his back turned upon the portrait
upon which he had been at work. It was evident
that something untoward was in the air,
because Pierre, who always smoked, was not
smoking, and Pierre, who never scowled, was
scowling.</p>

<p>In the Quartier&mdash;that Quartier which alone,
of them all, is spelt with a capital Q&mdash;there
was, in ordinary, no gayer, more happy-go-lucky
type than this same Pierre. He lived,
as did a thousand of his kind, on eighty sous
a day (there were those who lived on less,
pardi!), and breakfasted, and dined, at that,&mdash;yes,
and paid himself an absinthe at the Deux
Magots at six o'clock, and a package of green
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>cigarettes, into the bargain. For the rest of
the time, he was understood to be working on
a portrait in his studio, and, what is more
surprising, often was. There was nothing remarkable
about Pierre's portraits, except that
occasionally he sold one, and for money&mdash;for
<em>actual money</em>, the astonishing animal! But if
any part of the modest proceeds of such a
transaction remained, after the rent had been
paid and a new canvas purchased, it was not
the caisse d'épargne which saw it, be sure of
that! For Pierre lived always for the next
twenty-four hours, and let the rest of time and
eternity look out for themselves.</p>

<p>Yet he took his work seriously. That was
the trouble. Even admitting that, thus far,
his orders had come only from the more prosperous
tradesmen of the Quartier, did that
mean, par exemple, that they would not come
in time from the millionaires of the sixteenth
arrondissement? By no means, whatever, said
Pierre. To be sure, he had never had the Salon
in the palm of his hand, so to speak, but what
of that? Jean-Paul himself would tell you that
it was all favoritism! So Pierre toiled away
at his portrait painting, and made a little competency,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>but, if the truth were told, no appreciable
progress from year's beginning to year's
end.</p>

<p>For once, however, his luck had played him
false. The fat restaurateur, whose wife's portrait
he had finished that afternoon and carried
at top speed, with the paint not yet dry, to the
rue du Bac, was out of town on business, and
would not return until the following evening;
and that, so far as Pierre was concerned, was
quite as bad as if he were not expected until
the following year. Pierre's total wealth
amounted to one five-franc piece and three
sous, and he had been relying upon the restaurateur's
four louis, to enable him to fulfill
his promise to Mimi. For the next day was her
fête, and they were to have breakfasted in the
country, and taken a boat upon the Seine, and
returned to dine under the trees. Not at Suresnes
or St. Cloud, ah, non! Something better
than that&mdash;the true country, sapristi! at
Poissy, twenty-eight kilometres from Paris.
All of which meant at least a louis, and, no
doubt, more! And where, demanded Pierre
of the great north window, where was a louis
to be found?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>

For there was a tacit understanding among
the comrades in the Quartier that there must
be no borrowing and lending of money. It
was a clause of their creed, which had been
adopted in the early days of their companionship,
for what was, clearly, the greatest general
good, the chances being that no one of them
would ever possess sufficient surplus capital
either to accommodate another or to repay an
accommodation. For a moment, to be sure, the
thought had crossed Pierre's mind, but he had
rejected it instantly as impracticable. Aside
from the unwritten compact, there was no one
of them all who could have been of service,
had he so willed. Even Jacques Courbet, who
possessed a disposition which would have impelled
him to chop off his right hand with the
utmost cheerfulness, if thereby he could have
gratified a friend, was worse than useless in
this emergency. Had it been a matter of forty
sous&mdash;but a louis! As well have asked him
for the Vénus de Milo, and had done with it.</p>

<p>So it was that, with the premonition of
Mimi's disappointed eyes cutting great gaps
in his tender heart, Pierre had four times
shrugged his shoulders, and quoted to himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>this favorite scrap of his remarkable philosophy,&mdash;"Oh,
lala! All this will arrange itself!"
and four times had paused, in the act
of lighting a cigarette, and plunged again into
the depths of despondent reverie. As he was
on the point of again repeating this entirely
futile operation, a distant clock struck six, and
Pierre, remembering that Mimi must even now
be waiting for him at the west door of St. Germain-des-Prés,
clapped on his cap, and sallied
forth into the gathering twilight.</p>

<p>It was apéritif hour at the Café des Deux
Magots, and the long, leather-covered benches
against the windows, and the double row of
little marble-topped tables in front were rapidly
filling, as Pierre and Mimi took their places,
and ordered two Turins à l'eau. A group of
American Beaux Arts men at their right were
chattering in their uncouth tongue, with occasional
scraps of Quartier slang, by way of local
color, and now and again hailing a newcomer
with exclamations, apparently of satisfaction,
which began with "Hello!" The boulevard
St. Germain was alive with people, walking
past with the admirable lack of haste which
distinguishes the Parisian, or waiting, in patient,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>voluble groups, for a chance to enter the
constantly arriving and departing trams and
omnibuses; and an unending succession of
open cabs filed slowly along the curb, their
drivers scanning the terrasse of the café for a
possible fare. The air was full of that mingled
odor of wet wood pavements and horse-chestnut
blossoms, which is the outward, invisible
sign of that most wonderful of inward
and spiritual combinations&mdash;Paris and Spring!
And, at the table directly behind Pierre and
Mimi sat Caffiard.</p>

<p>There was nothing about Caffiard to suggest
a <em>deus ex machina</em>, or anything else, for that
matter, except a preposterously corpulent old
gentleman with an amiable smile. But in nothing
were appearances ever more deceitful
than in Caffiard. For it was he, with his enormous
double chin, and his general air of harmless
fatuity, who edited the little colored sheet
entitled La Blague, which sent half Paris into
convulsions of merriment every Thursday morning,
and he who knew every caricaturist in
town, and was beloved of them all for the
heartiness of his appreciation and the liberality
of his payments. In the first regard he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>but one of many Parisian editors: but in the
second he stood without a peer. Caran d'Ache,
Léandre, Willette, Forain, Hermann Paul, Abel
Faivre&mdash;they rubbed their hands when they
came out of Caffiard's private office, and if the
day chanced to be Saturday, there was something
in their hands worth rubbing. A fine
example, Caffiard!</p>

<p>Mimi's black eyes sparkled like a squirrel's
as she watched Pierre over the rim of her
tumbler of vermouth. She was far from being
blind, Mimi, and already, though they had
been together but six minutes, she had noted
that unusual little pucker between his eyebrows,
that sad little droop at the corners of
his merry mouth. She told herself that Pierre
had been overworking himself, that Pierre was
tired, that Pierre needed cheering up. So
Mimi, who was never tired, not even after ten
hours in Madame Fraichel's millinery establishment,
secretly declared war upon the unusual
little pucker and the sad little droop.</p>

<p>"Voyons donc, my Pierrot!" she said. "It
is not a funeral to which we go to-morrow, at
least! Thou must be gay, for we have much to
talk of, thou knowest. One dines at La Boîte?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>

"The dinner is there, such as it is," replied
Pierre gloomily.</p>

<p>"What it is now, is not the question," said
Mimi, with confidence, "but what I make of it&mdash;pas?
And then there is to-morrow! Oh,
lala, lalala! What a pleasure it will be, if only
the good God gives us beautiful weather. Dis,
donc, great thunder-cloud, dost thou know it,
this Poissy?"</p>

<p>Pierre had begun a caricature on the back
of the wine-card, glancing now and again at his
model, an old man selling newspapers on the
curb. He shook his head without replying.</p>

<p>"Eh, b'en, my little one, thou mayest believe
me that it is of all places the most beautiful!
One eats at the Esturgeon, on the Seine,&mdash;but
<em>on</em> the Seine, with the water quite near, like
that chair. He names himself Jarry, the proprietor,
and it is a good type&mdash;fat and handsome.
I adore him! Art thou jealous, species
of thinness of a hundred nails? B'en, afterwards,
one takes a boat, and goes, softly, softly,
down the little arm of the Seine, and creeps
under the willows, and, perhaps, fishes. But
no, for it is the closed season. But one sings,
eh? What does one sing? Voyons!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>

She bent forward, and, in a little voice, like
an elf's, very thin and sweet, hummed a snatch
of a song they both knew.</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>"C'est votre ami Pierrot qui vient vous voir:</em></div>
<div class="i10"><em>Bonsoir, madame la lune!"</em></div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>"And then," she went on, as Pierre continued
his sketch in silence, "and then, one
disembarks at Villennes and has a Turin under
the arbors of Bodin. Another handsome type,
Bodin! Flut! <em>What</em> a man!"</p>

<p>Mimi paused suddenly, and searched his
cloudy face with her earnest, tender little eyes.</p>

<p>"Pierrot," she said, softly, "what hast thou?
Thou art not angry with thy gosseline?"</p>

<p>Pierre surveyed the outline of the newspaper
vender thoughtfully, touched it, here and there,
with his pencil-point, squinted, and then pushed
the paper toward the girl.</p>

<p>"Not bad," he said, replacing his pencil in
his pocket.</p>

<p>But Mimi had no eyes for the caricature,
and merely flicked the wine-card to the ground.</p>

<p>"Pierrot"&mdash;she repeated.</p>

<p>Vauquelin plunged his hands in his pockets
and looked at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then," he announced, almost brutally,
"we do not go to-morrow."</p>

<p>"<em>Pierre!</em>"</p>

<p>It was going to be much worse than he had
supposed, this little tragedy. Bon Dieu, how
pretty she was, with her startled, hurt eyes,
already filling with tears, and her parted lips,
and her little white hand, that had flashed up
to her cheek at his words! Oh, much worse
than he had supposed! But she must be told:
there was nothing but that. So Pierre put his
elbows on the table, and his chin in his hands,
and brought his face close to hers.</p>

<p>"Voyons!" he explained, "thou dost not
believe me angry! Mais non, mais non! But
listen. It is I who am the next to the last of
idiots, since I have never a sou in pocket,
never! And the imbecile restaurateur, whose
wife I have been painting, will not return until
to-morrow, and so I am not paid. Voilà!"</p>

<p>He placed his five-franc piece upon the table,
and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"One full moon!" he said, and piled the
three sous upon it. "And three soldiers. As
I sit here, that is all, until to-morrow night.
We cannot go!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>

Brave little Mimi! Already she was winking
back her tears, and smiling.</p>

<p>"But that&mdash;that is nothing!" she answered.
"I do not care to go. No&mdash;but truly! Look!
We shall spend the day in the studio, and breakfast
on the balcony, and pretend the rue Visconti
is the Seine."</p>

<p>"I am an empty siphon!" said Pierre, yielding
to desperation.</p>

<p>"<em>Non!</em>" said Mimi firmly.</p>

<p>"I am a pierced basket, a box of matches!"</p>

<p>"<em>Non! Non!</em>" said Mimi, with tremendous
earnestness. "Thou art Pierrot, and I love
thee! Let us say no more. I shall go back
and prepare the dinner, and thou shalt remain
and drink a Pernod. It will give thee heart.
But follow quickly. Give me the key."</p>

<p>She laid her wide-spread hand on his, palm
upward, like a little pink starfish.</p>

<p>"We go together, and I adore thee!" said
Pierre, and kissed her in the sight of all men,
and was not ashamed.</p>

<p class="p2">Caffiard leaned forward, picked up the fallen
wine-card, pretended to consult it, and ponderously
arose. As Pierre was turning the key
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>in the door of the little apartment, they heard
a sound of heavy breathing, and the <em>deus ex
machina</em> came lumbering up the winding stair.</p>

<p>"Monsieur is seeking some one?" asked the
painter politely.</p>

<p>There was no breath left in Caffiard. He
was only able, by way of reply, to point at the
top button of Pierre's coat, and nod helplessly:
then, as Mimi ran ahead to light the gas, he
labored along the corridor, staggered through
the curtained doorway, stumbled over a rattan
stool, was rescued by Pierre, and, finally, established
upon the divan, very red and gasping.</p>

<p>For a time there was silence, Pierre and
Mimi busying themselves in putting the studio
to rights, with an instinctive courtesy which
took no notice of their visitor's snorts and
wheezes; and Caffiard taking note of his surroundings
with his round, blinking eyes. Opposite
him, against the wall, reposed the portrait
of the restaurateur's wife, as dry and pasty as
a stale cream cheese upon the point of crumbling,
and on an easel was another&mdash;that of
Monsieur Pantin, the rich shirt-maker of the
boulevard St. Germain&mdash;on which Pierre was
at work. A veritable atrocity this, with a green
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>background which trespassed upon Monsieur
Pantin's hair, and a featureless face, gaunt and
haggard with yellow and purple undertones.
There was nothing in either picture to refute
one's natural suspicion that soap had been the
medium employed. Caffiard blinked harder
still as his eyes rested upon the portraits, and
he secretly consulted the crumpled wine-card
in his hand. Then he seemed to recover his
breath by means of a profound sigh.</p>

<p>"Monsieur makes caricatures?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Ah, monsieur," said Pierre, "at times, and
for amusement only. I am a portraitist." And
he pointed proudly to the picture against the
wall.</p>

<p>For they are all alike, these painters&mdash;proudest
of what they do least well!</p>

<p>"Ah! Then," said Caffiard, with an air of
resignation, "I must ask monsieur's pardon,
and descend. I am not interested in portraits.
When it comes to caricatures"&mdash;</p>

<p>"They are well enough in their way," put in
Pierre, "but as a serious affair&mdash;to sell, for
instance&mdash;well, monsieur comprehends that
one does not debauch one's art!"</p>

<p>Oh, yes, they are all alike, these painters!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>

"What is serious, what is not serious?"
answered Caffiard. "It is all a matter of
opinion. One prefers to have his painting
glued to the wall of the Salon, next the ceiling,
another to have his drawing on the front page
of La Blague."</p>

<p>"Oh, naturally La Blague," protested Pierre.</p>

<p>"I am its editor," said Caffiard superbly.</p>

<p>"<em>Eigh!</em>" exclaimed Pierre. For Mimi had
cruelly pinched his arm. Before the sting had
passed, she was seated at Caffiard's side, tugging
at the strings of a great portfolio.</p>

<p>"Are they imbeciles, these painters, monsieur?"
she was saying. "Now you shall see.
This great baby is marvelous, but <em>marvelous</em>,
with his caricatures. Not Léandre himself&mdash;it
is I who assure you, monsieur!&mdash;and to
hear him, one would think&mdash;but thou <em>tirest</em>
me, Pierrot!&mdash;With his portraits! No, it is
<em>too</em> much!"</p>

<p>She spread the portfolio wide, and began to
shuffle through the drawings it contained.</p>

<p>Caffiard's eyes glistened as he saw them.
Even in her enthusiasm, Mimi had not overshot
the mark. They were marvelous indeed,
these caricatures, mere outlines for the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>part, with a dot, here and there, of red, or a
little streak of green, which lent them a curious,
unusual charm. The subjects were legion.
Here was Loubet, with a great band of crimson
across his shirt bosom, here Waldeck-Rousseau,
with eyes as round and prominent as agate marbles,
or Yvette, with a nose on which one might
have hung an overcoat, or Chamberlain, all
monocle, or Wilhelmina, growing out of a tulip's
heart, and as pretty as an old print, with
her tight-fitting Dutch cap and broidered bodice.
And then a host of types&mdash;cochers, grisettes,
flower women, camelots, Heaven knows
what not!&mdash;the products of half a hundred
idle hours, wherein great-hearted, foolish Pierre
had builded better than he knew!</p>

<p>Caffiard selected five at random, and then,
from a waistcoat pocket that clung as closely
to his round figure as if it had been glued
thereto, produced a hundred-franc note.</p>

<p>"I must have these for La Blague, monsieur,"
he said. "Bring me two caricatures a week at
my office in the rue St. Joseph, and you shall
be paid at the same rate. It is not much, to be
sure. But you will have ample time left for
your&mdash;for your portrait-painting, monsieur!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>

For a moment the words of Caffiard affected
Pierre and Mimi as the stairs had affected Caffiard.
They stared at him, opening and shutting
their mouths and gasping, like fish newly
landed. Then, suddenly, animated by a common
impulse, they rushed into each other's
arms, and set out, around the studio, in a mad
waltz, which presently resolved itself into an
impromptu can-can, with Mimi skipping like a
fairy, and Pierre singing: "Hi! <em>Hi!!</em> <span class="smcap">Hi!!!</span>"
and snapping at her flying feet with a red-bordered
handkerchief. After this Mimi kissed
Caffiard twice: once on the top of his bald
head, and once on the end of his stubby nose.
It was like being brushed by the floating down
of a dandelion. And, finally, nothing would
do but that he must accompany them upon the
morrow; and she explained to him in detail
the plan which had so nearly fallen through,
and the <em>deus ex machina</em> did not betray by so
much as a wink that he had heard the entire
story only half an hour before.</p>

<p>But, in the end, he protested. But she was
insane, the little one, completely! Had he
then the air of one who gave himself into those
boats there, name of a pipe? But let us be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>reasonable, voyons! He was not young like
Pierre and Mimi&mdash;one comprehended that
these holidays did not recommence when one
was sixty. What should he do, he demanded
of them, trailing along, as one might say, he
and his odious fatness? Ah, <em>non</em>! For la belle
jeunesse was la belle jeunesse, there was no
means of denying it, and it was not for a species
of dried sponge to be giving itself the
airs of a fresh flower. "But no! But no!"
said Caffiard, striving to rise from the divan.
"In the morning I have my article to do for
the Figaro, and I am going with Caran to
Longchamp, en auto, for the races in the afternoon.
But no! But no!"</p>

<p>It was plain that Caffiard had known Mimi
no more than half an hour. One never said,
"But no! But no!" to Mimi, unless it was
for the express purpose of having one's mouth
covered by the softest little pink palm to be
found between the Seine and the Observatoire,&mdash;which,
to do him justice, Caffiard was quite
capable of scheming to bring about, if only he
had known! He had accepted the little dandelion-down
kisses in a spirit of philosophy, knowing
well that they were given not for his sake,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>but for Pierre's. But now his protests came
to an abrupt termination, for Mimi suddenly
seated herself on his lap, and put one arm
around his neck.</p>

<p>It was nothing short of an achievement, this.
Even Caffiard himself had not imagined that
such a thing as his lap was still extant. Yet
here was Mimi, actually installed thereon, with
her cheek pressed against his, and her breath,
which was like clover, stirring the ends of his
moustache. But she was smiling at Pierre,
the witch! Caffiard could see it out of the
corner of his eye.</p>

<p>"Mais non!" he repeated, but more feebly.</p>

<p>"Mais non! Mais non! Mais non!" mocked
Mimi. "Great farceur! Will you listen, at
least? Eh b'en, voilà! Here is my opinion.
As to insanity, if for any one to propose a day
in the country is insanity, well then, yes,&mdash;I
am insane! Soit! And, again, if you wish to
appear serious,&mdash;in Paris, that is to say&mdash;soit,
également! But when you speak of odious
fatness, you are a type of monsieur extremely
low of ceiling, do you know! Moreover, you
are going. Voilà! It is finished. As for
Caran, let him go his way and draw his caricatures&mdash;though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>they are not like Pierre's, all
the world knows!&mdash;and, without doubt, his
auto will refuse to move beyond the porte
Dauphine, yes, and blow up, bon Dieu! when
he is in the act of mending it. One knows
these boxes of vapors, what they do. And as
for the Figaro, b'en, flut! Evidently it will not
cease to exist for lack of your article&mdash;eh,
l'ami? And it is Mimi who asks you,&mdash;Mimi,
do you understand, who invites you to her fête.
And you would refuse her&mdash;<em>toi</em>!"</p>

<p>"But no! But no!" said Caffiard hurriedly.
And meant it.</p>

<p>At this point Pierre wrapped five two-sou
pieces in a bit of paper, and tossed them, out
of a little window across the hallway, to a
street-singer whimpering in the court below.
Pierre said that they weighed down his pockets.
They were in the way, the clumsy doublins,
said wonderful, spendthrift Pierre!</p>

<p>For the wide sky of the Quartier is forever
dotted with little clouds, scudding, scudding,
all day long. And when one of these passes
across the sun, there is a sudden chill in the
air, and one walks for a time in shadow, though
the comrade over there, across the way, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>still in the warm and golden glow. But when
the sun has shouldered the little cloud aside
again, ah, that is when life is good to live, and
goes gayly, to the tinkle of glasses and the
ripple of laughter, and the ring of silver bits.
And when the street-singer in the court receives
upon his head a little parcel of coppers that
are too heavy for the pocket, and smiles to
himself, who knows but what he understands?</p>

<p>For what is also true of the Quartier is this&mdash;that,
in sunshine or shadow, one finds a soft
little hand clasping his, firm, warm, encouraging
and kindly, and hears a gay little voice
that, in foul weather, chatters of the bright
hours which it is so sweet to remember, and,
in fair, says never a word of the storms which
it is so easy to forget!</p>

<p>The veriest bat might have foreseen the end,
when once Mimi had put her arm around the
neck of Caffiard. Before the <em>deus ex machina</em>
knew what he was about, he found his army of
objections routed, horse, foot, and dragoons,
and had promised to be at the gare St. Lazare
at eleven the following morning.</p>

<p>And what a morning it was! Surely the
bon Dieu must have loved Mimi an atom better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>than other mortals, for in the blue-black crucible
of the night he fashioned a day as clear
and glowing as a great jewel, and set it, blazing
with warm light and vivid color, foremost
in the diadem of the year. And it was something
to see Mimi at the carriage window, with
Pierre at her side and her left hand in his, and
in her right a huge bouquet&mdash;Caffiard's contribution&mdash;while
the <em>deus ex machina</em> himself,
breathing like a happy hippopotamus, beamed
upon the pair from the opposite corner. So
the train slipped past the fortifications, swung
through a trim suburb, slid smoothly out into
the open country. It was a Wednesday, and
there was no holiday crowd to incommode
them. They had the compartment to themselves;
and the half hour flew like six minutes,
said Mimi, when at last they came to a
shuddering standstill, and two guards hastened
along the platform in opposite directions, one
droning "Poiss-y-y-y-y!" and the other shouting
"Poiss'! Poiss'! Poiss'!" as if he had been
sneezing. It was an undertaking to get Caffiard
out of the carriage, just as it had been to
get him in. But finally it was accomplished,
a whistle trilled from somewhere as if it had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>been a bird, another wailed like a stepped-on
kitten, the locomotive squealed triumphantly,
and the next minute the trio were alone in
their glory.</p>

<p>It was a day that Caffiard never forgot.
They breakfasted at once, so as to have a
longer afternoon. Mimi was guide and commander-in-chief,
as having been to the Esturgeon
before, so the table was set upon the
terrasse overlooking the Seine, and there were
radishes, and little individual omelettes, and a
famous matelote, which Monsieur Jarry himself
served with the air of a Lucullus, and, finally,
a great dish of quatre saisons, and, for each of
the party, a squat brown pot of fresh cream.
And, moreover, no ordinaire, but St. Emilion,
if you please, with a tin-foil cap which had to
be removed before one could draw the cork,
and a bottle of Source Badoit as well. And
Caffiard, who had dined with the Russian Ambassador
on Monday and breakfasted with the
Nuncio on Tuesday, and been egregiously displeased
with the fare in both instances, consumed
an unprecedented quantity of matelote,
and went back to radishes after he had eaten
his strawberries and cream: while, to cap the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>climax, Pierre paid the addition with a louis,&mdash;and
gave <em>all</em> the change as a tip! But it was
unheard-of!</p>

<p>Afterwards they engaged a boat, and, with
much alarm on the part of Mimi, and satirical
comment from Caffiard, and severe admonitions
to prudence by Pierre, pushed out into
the stream and headed for Villennes, to the
enormous edification of three small boys, who
hung precariously over the railing of the terrace
above them, and called Caffiard a captive
balloon.</p>

<p>They made the three kilometres at a snail's
pace, allowing the boat to drift with the current
for an hour at a time, and, now and again
creeping in under the willows at the water's
edge until they were wholly hidden from view,
and the voice of Mimi singing was as that
of some river nixie invisible to mortal eyes.
She sang "Bonsoir, Madame la Lune," so
sweetly and so sadly that Caffiard was moved
to tears. It was her favorite song, because&mdash;oh,
because it was about Pierrot! And her
own Pierrot responded with a gay soldier ballad,
a chanson de route which he had picked up at
the Noctambules; and even Caffiard sang&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>ridiculous ditty it was, which scored the English
and went to a rollicking air. They all
shouted the refrain, convulsed with merriment
at the drollery of the sound:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><em>"Qu'est ce qui quitte ses père et mère</em></div>
<div class="i4"><em>Afin de s'en aller</em></div>
<div class="i4"><em>S'faire taper dans le nez?</em></div>
<div class="i0"><em>C'est le soldat d'Angleterre!</em></div>
<div class="i4"><em>Dou-gle-di-gle-dum!</em></div>
<div class="i0"><em>Avec les ba-a-a-alles dum-dum!"</em></div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Caffiard was to leave them at Villennes after
they should have taken their apéritifs. They
protested, stormed at him, scolded and cajoled
by turns, and called him a score of fantastic
names&mdash;for by this time they knew him intimately&mdash;as
they sat in Monsieur Bodin's
arbor and sipped amer-menthe, but all in vain.
Pierre had Mimi's hand, as always, and he had
kissed her a half-hundred times in the course
of the afternoon. Mimi had a way of shaking
her hair out of her eyes with a curious little
backward jerk of her head when Pierre kissed
her, and then looking at him seriously, seriously,
but smiling when he caught her at it.
Caffiard liked that. And Pierre had a trick of
turning, as if to ask Mimi's opinion, or divine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>even her unspoken wishes whenever a question
came up for decision&mdash;a choice of food or
drink, or direction, or what-not. And Caffiard
liked <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>He looked across the table at them now,
dreamily, through his cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>"Pierrot," he said, after he had persuaded
them to let him depart in peace when the train
should be due,&mdash;"Pierrot. Yes, that is it.
You, with your garret, and your painting, and
your songs, and your black, black sadness at
one moment, and your laughter the next, and,
above all, your Pierrette, your bon-bon of a
Pierrette:&mdash;you are Pierrot, the spirit of Paris
in powder and white muslin! Eigho! my
children, what a thing it is, la belle jeunesse!
Tiens! you have given me a taste of it to-day,
and I thank you. I thought I had forgotten.
But no, one never forgets. It all comes back,&mdash;youth,
and strength, and beauty, love, and
music, and laughter,&mdash;but only like a breath
upon a mirror, my children, only like a wind-ripple
on a pool; for I am an old man."</p>

<p>He paused, looking up at the vine-leaves
on the trellis-roof, and murmured a few words
of Mimi's song:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
<div class="i0"><em>"Pierrette en songe va venir me voir:</em></div>
<div class="i4"><em>Bonsoir, madame la lune!"</em></div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Then his eyes came back to her face.</p>

<p>"I must be off," he said. "Why, what hast
thou, little one? There are tears in those two
stars!"</p>

<p>"C'est vrai?" asked Mimi, smiling at him
and then at Pierre, and brushing her hand
across her eyes, "c'est vrai? Well then, they
are gone as quickly as they came. Voilà!
Without his tears Pierrot is not Pierrot, and
without Pierrot"&mdash;</p>

<p>She turned to Pierre suddenly, and buried
her face on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"<em>Je t'aime!</em>" she whispered. "<em>Je t'aime!</em>"</p>

<h2><a id="The_Next_Corner"></a>The Next Corner</h2>

<p class="dropcap">ANTHONY CAZEBY was a man whom
the felicitous combination of an adventurous
disposition, sufficient ready
money, and a magnificent constitution had introduced
to many and various sensations, but
he was conscious that, so far as intensity went,
no one of them all had approached for a moment
that with which he emerged from the
doorway of the Automobile Club, and, winking
at the sting of the keen winter air, looked
out across the place de la Concorde, with its
globes of light, swung, like huge pearls on invisible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>strings, across the haze of the January
midnight. He paused for a moment, as if he
would allow his faculties to obtain a full and
final grasp of his situation, and motioned aside
the trim little club chasseur who stood before
him, with one cotton-gloved hand stretched out
expectantly for a supposititious carriage-check.</p>

<p>"Va, mon petit, je vais à pied!"</p>

<p>Afoot! Cazeby smiled to himself at the
tone of sudden caprice which rang in his voice,
and, turning his fur collar high up about his
ears, swung off rapidly toward the Cours la
Reine. After all, the avenue d'Eylau was only
an agreeable stroll's length distant. Why not
go home afoot? But then, on the other hand,
why go home at all? As this thought leaped
suddenly at Cazeby's throat out of the void of
the great unpremeditated, he caught his breath,
stopped suddenly in the middle of the driveway,
and then went on more slowly, thinking hard.</p>

<p>It had been that <em>rarissima avis</em> of social life,
even in Paris, a perfect dinner. Cazeby had
found himself wondering, at more than one
stage of its smooth and imposing progress, how
the Flints could afford to do it. But on each
recurrence of the thought he dismissed it with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>a little frown of vexation. If there was one
thing more than another upon which Cazeby
prided himself, it was originality of thought,
word, and deed, and he was annoyed to find
himself, even momentarily, on a mental level
with the gossips of the American and English
colonies, whose time is equally divided between
wondering how the Choses can afford to do
what they do, and why the Machins cannot
afford to do what they leave undone.</p>

<p>People had said many things of Hartley
Flint, and still more of his wife, but no one
had ever had the ignorance or the perversity
to accuse them of inefficiency in the matter of
a dinner. Moreover, on this particular occasion,
they were returning the hospitality of the
Baroness Klemftt, who had, at the close of
the Exposition, impressed into her service the
chef of the Roumanian restaurant, and whose
dinners were, in consequence, the wonder and
despair of four foreign colonies. After her
latest exploit Hartley Flint had remarked to
his wife that it was "up to them to make
good," which, being interpreted, was to say
that it was at once his duty and his intention
to repay the Baroness in her own sterling coin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>The fact that the men of the party afterwards
commended Hartley's choice of wines, and that
the women expressed the opinion that "Kate
Flint looked <em>really</em> pretty!" would seem to be
proof positive that the operation of "making
good" had been an unqualified success.</p>

<p>Now, Cazeby was wondering whether he
had actually enjoyed it all. Under the circumstances
it seemed to him incredible, and
yet he could not recall a qualm of uneasiness
from the moment when the maître d'hôtel had
thrown open the doors of the private dining
room, until the Baroness had smiled at her
hostess out of a cloud of old Valenciennes,
and said, "Now there are <em>two</em> of us who give
impeccable dinners, Madame Flint." Even
now, even facing his last ditch, Cazeby was
conscious of a little thrill of self-satisfaction.
He had said the score of clever things which
each of his many hostesses expected of him,
and had told with great effect his story of the
little German florist, which had grown, that
season, under the persuasive encouragement
of society's applause, from a brief anecdote
into a veritable achievement of Teutonic dialect.
Also, he had worn a forty franc orchid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>and had left it in his coffee-cup because it had
begun to wilt. In brief, he had been Anthony
Cazeby at his extraordinary best, a mixture
of brilliancy and eccentricity, without which,
as Mrs. Flint was wont to say, no dinner was
complete.</p>

<p>But the sublime and the ridiculous are not
the only contrasting conditions that lie no
further than a step apart, and Cazeby was
painfully conscious of having, in the past five
minutes, crossed the short interval which divides
gay from grave. Reduced to its lowest
terms, his situation lay in his words to the
little chasseur. With the odor of the rarest
orchid to be found in Vaillant-Rozeau's whole
establishment yet clinging to his lapel, Anthony
Cazeby was going home on foot because the
fare from the Concorde to the avenue d'Eylau
was one franc fifty, and one franc fifty precisely
ninety centimes more than he possessed
in the world. For a moment he straightened
himself, threw back his head, and looked up
at the dull saffron of the low-hanging sky, in an
attempt to realize this astounding fact, and then
went back to his thinking.</p>

<p>Well, it was not surprising. The life of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>popular young diplomat with extravagant tastes
is not conducive to economy, and the forty
thousand dollars which had come to Cazeby
at the beginning of his twenty-eighth year had
proved but a bad second best in the struggle
with Parisian gayety. His bibelots, his servants,
Auteuil, Longchamp, his baccarat at the Prince
de Tréville's, a dancer at the Folies-Marigny,
Monte Carlo, Aix, Trouville,&mdash;they had all
had their share, and now the piper was waiting
to be paid and the exchequer was empty. It
was an old story. Other men of his acquaintance
had done the same, but they had had
some final resource. The trouble was, as
Cazeby had already noted, that, in his case,
the final resource was not, as in theirs, pecuniary.
Quite on the contrary, it was a tidy little
weapon, of Smith and Wesson make, which lay
in the upper right hand drawer of his marqueterie
desk. He had looked long at it that same
afternoon, with all his worldly wealth, in the
shape of forty-two francs sixty, spread out beside
it. That was before he had taken a fiacre
to Vaillant-Rozeau's.</p>

<p>At the very moment when Cazeby was contemplating
these doubtful assets, a grim old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>gentleman was seated at another desk, three
thousand miles away, engaged upon a calculation
of the monthly profits derived from a
wholesale leather business. But Cazeby père
was one of the hopeless persons who believe
in economy. He was of the perverted opinion
that money hardly come by should be thoughtfully
spent, or, preferably, invested in government
bonds, and he had violent prejudices
against "industrials," games of chance, and
young men who preferred the gayety of a foreign
capital to the atmosphere of "the Swamp."
Also he was very rich. But Anthony had long
since ceased to regard his father as anything
more than a chance relation. He could have
told what would be the result of a frank confession
of his extremity as accurately as if the
avowal had been already made. There would
have been some brief reference to the sowing
of oats and their reaping, to the making of a
metaphorical bed and the inevitable occupancy
thereof, and to other proverbial illustrations
which, in a financial sense, are more ornamental
than useful,&mdash;and nothing more. The
essential spark of sympathy had been lacking
between these two since the moment when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>most eminent physician in New York had said,
"It is a boy, sir,&mdash;but&mdash;we cannot hope to
save the mother." The fault may have lain
on the one side, or the other, or on both, or on
neither; but certain it is that to Anthony's
imagination Cazeby senior had never appealed
in the light of a final resource.</p>

<p>Somehow, in none of his calculations had
the idea of invoking assistance ever played a
part. Naturally, as a reasoning being, he had
foreseen the present crisis for some months,
but at the time when the inevitable catastrophe
first became clear to him it was already too late
to regain his balance, since the remainder of
his inheritance was so pitifully small that any
idea of retrieving his fortunes through its instrumentality
was simply farcical. The swirl of
the rapids, as he had then told himself, had
already caught his boat. All that was left to
do was to go straight on to the sheer of the fall,
with his pennant flying and himself singing at
the helm. Then, on the brink, a well-placed
bullet&mdash;no bungling for Anthony Cazeby!&mdash;and
the next day people would be talking of
the shocking accident which had killed him in
the act of cleaning his revolver, and saying the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>usual things about a young man with a brilliant
future before him and everything in life for
which to live.</p>

<p>And this plan he had carried out in every
detail&mdash;save the last, to which he was now
come; and his was the satisfying conviction
that not one of the brilliant, careless men and
women, among whom he lived, and moved, and
had his being, suspected for a moment that the
actual circumstances differed in the least from
the outward appearances. He thought it all
over carefully now, and there was no play in
the entire game that he felt he would have
liked to have changed.</p>

<p>Sentiment had no part in the makeup of
Anthony Cazeby. Lacking from early childhood
the common ties of home affection, and
by training and profession a diplomat, he
added to a naturally undemonstrative nature
the non-committal suavity of official poise. But
that was not all. He had never been known
to be ill at ease. This was something which
gained him a reputation for studious self-control.
As a matter of fact it was due to nothing
of the sort. No one had ever come fairly at
the root of his character except Cazeby père,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>who once said, in a fit of passion, "You don't
care a brass cent, sir, whether you live and are
made President of the United States, or die
and are eternally damned!" And that was
exactly the point.</p>

<p>Something of all this had passed through
Cazeby's mind, when he was suddenly aroused
to an appreciation of his whereabouts by the
sound of a voice, to find that the curious instinct
of direction which underlies advanced
inebriety and profound preoccupation alike,
had led him up the avenue du Trocadéro, and
across the place, and that he had already advanced
some little way along the avenue d'Eylau
in the direction of his apartment. The
street was dimly lighted, but, just behind him,
the windows of a tiny wine-shop gave out a
subdued glow, and from within came the sound
of a violin. Then Cazeby's attention came
around to the owner of the voice. This was a
youngish man of medium stature, in the familiar
street dress of a French laborer, jacket and
waistcoat of dull blue velveteen, peg-top trousers
of heavy corduroy, a crimson knot at his
throat, and a dark tam o'shanter pulled low
over one ear. As their eyes met, he apparently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>saw that Cazeby had not heard his first remark,
and so repeated it.</p>

<p>"I have need of a drink!"</p>

<p>There was nothing of the beggar in his tone
or manner. Both were threatening, rather;
and, as soon as he had spoken, he thrust his
lower jaw forward, in the fashion common to
the thug of any and every nationality when the
next move is like to be a blow. But, for once,
these manifestations of hostility failed signally
of effect. Cazeby was the last person in the
world to select as the object of sudden attack,
with the idea that panic would make him easy
prey. In his present state of mind he went
further than preserving his equanimity: he was
even faintly amused. It was not that he did
not comprehend the other's purpose, but, to
his way of thinking, there was something distinctly
humorous in the idea of holding up a
man with only sixty centimes to his name, and
menacing him with injury, when he himself
was on his way to the upper right hand drawer
of the marqueterie desk.</p>

<p>"I have need of a drink," repeated the
other, coming a step nearer. "Thou art not
deaf, at least?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>

"No," said Cazeby, pleasantly, "no, I am
not deaf, and I, too, have need of a drink.
Shall we take it together?" And, without
waiting for a reply, he turned and stepped
through the doorway of the little wineshop.
The Frenchman hesitated, shrugged his shoulders
with an air of complete bewilderment, and,
after an instant also entered the shop and
placed himself at the small table where Cazeby
was already seated.</p>

<p>"A vitriol for me," he said.</p>

<p>Cazeby had not passed three years in Paris
for nothing. He received this remarkable request
with the unconcern of one to whom the
slang of the exterior boulevards is sufficiently
familiar, and, as the proprietor leaned across
the nickled slab of his narrow counter with an
air of interrogation, duplicated his companion's
order.</p>

<p>"Deux vitriols!"</p>

<p>The proprietor, vouchsafing the phrase a
grin of appreciation, lumbered heavily around
to the table, filled two small glasses from a
bottle of cheap cognac, and stood awaiting payment,
hands on hips.</p>

<p>"Di-ze sous," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>

There was no need to search for the exact
amount. Cazeby spun his fifty-centime piece
upon the marble, added his remaining two
sous by way of pourboire, and disposed of the
brandy at a gulp.</p>

<p>"Have you also need of a cigarette?" he
inquired, politely, tendering the other his case.</p>

<p>For some minutes, as they smoked, the
diplomat and the vagabond took stock of each
other in silence. In many ways they were singularly
alike. There was in both the same
irony of lip line, the same fair chiseling of chin
and nostril and brow, the same weariness of
eye. The difference was one of dress and
bearing alone, and, in those first moments of
mutual analysis, Cazeby realized that there
was about this street-lounger a vague air of the
gentleman, a subtle suggestion of good birth
and breeding, which even his slouching manner
and coarse speech were not wholly able to
conceal: and his guest was conscious that in
Cazeby he had to deal with no mere society
puppet, but with one in whom the limitations
of position had never wholly subdued the devil-may-care
instincts of the vagabond. The one
was a finished model of a man of the world,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>the other a caricature, but the clay was the
same.</p>

<p>"I am also hungry," said the latter suddenly.</p>

<p>"In that respect," responded Cazeby, in
the same tone of even politeness, "I am, unfortunately,
unable to assist you, unless you
will accept the hospitality of my apartment.
It is but a step, and I am rather an expert on
bacon and eggs. Also," he added, falling into
the idiom of the faubourgs, "there is a means
there of remedying the dryness of the sponge in
one's throat. My name is Antoine."</p>

<p>"I am Bibi-la-Raie," said the other shortly.
Then he continued, with instinctive suspicion,
"It is a strange fashion thou hast of introducing
a type to these gentlemen."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," said Cazeby, "I do
not live over a poste. But whether or not you
will come is something for you to decide. It
is less trouble to cook eggs for one than for
two."</p>

<p>Bibi-la-Raie reflected briefly. Finally he had
recourse to his characteristic shrug.</p>

<p>"After all, what difference?" he said. "As
well now as another time. I follow thee!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>

The strangely assorted companions entered
Cazeby's apartment as the clock was striking
one, and pressure of an electric button, flooding
the salon with light, revealed a little tea-table
furnished with cigarettes and cigars,
decanters of Scotch whiskey and liqueurs,
and Venetian goblets of oddly tinted glass.
Cazeby shot a swift glance at his guest as this
array sprang into view, and was curiously content
to observe that he manifested no surprise.
Bibi-la-Raie had flung himself into a great
leather chair with an air of being entirely at
ease.</p>

<p>"Not bad, thy little box," he observed. "Is
it permitted?"</p>

<p>He indicated the table with a nod.</p>

<p>"Assuredly," said Cazeby. "Do as if you
were at home. I shall be but a moment with
the supper."</p>

<p>When he returned from the kitchen, bearing
a smoking dish of bacon and eggs, butter, rye
bread, and Swiss cheese, Bibi-la-Raie was
standing in rapt contemplation before an etching
of the "Last Judgment."</p>

<p>"What a genius, this animal of a Michel
Ange!" he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>

"Rather deft at times," replied Cazeby,
arranging the dishes on the larger table.</p>

<p>"Je te crois!" said Bibi, enthusiastically.
"Without him&mdash;what? Evidently, it was not
Léon Treize who built Saint Pierre!"</p>

<p>The eggs had been peculiarly obstinate, as
it happened, and a growing irritability had
taken possession of Anthony. As they ate in
silence, the full force of his tragic position
returned to him. Even the unwontedness of
his chance encounter with Bibi-la-Raie had
not wholly dispelled the cloud that had been
gradually settling around him since he emerged
from the Automobile Club, and, as they finished
the little repast, he turned suddenly upon his
guest, in a burst of irritation.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he said. "And what does
all this mean? Was I mistaken, when you first
spoke to me, in thinking you a mere voyou?
Surely not! You meant to rob me. You speak
the argot of the fortifications. Yet here I find
you discoursing on Michel Angelo as though
you were the conservateur of the Uffizzi! What
am I to think?"</p>

<p>Bibi-la-Raie lit another cigarette, blew forth
the smoke in a thin, gray wisp, and thrust his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>thumbs into the arm-holes of his velveteen
waistcoat.</p>

<p>"And <em>you</em>," he said, slowly, abandoning the
familiar address he had been using, "who are
<em>you</em>? No, you were not mistaken in thinking
I meant to rob you. Such is my profession.
But does a gentleman reply, in ordinary, to the
summons of a thief by paying that thief a drink?
Does he invite him to his apartment and cook
a supper for him? What am <em>I</em> to think?"</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, and then he faced
his host squarely.</p>

<p>"Are you absolutely resolved to put an end
to it all to-night?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Cazeby made a small sign of bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Ah, mon vieux," continued the other. "That,
you know, is of no use with me. You ask me
who I am. For one thing, I am one who has
lived too long in touch with desperate men not
to know the look in the eyes when the end has
come. You think you are going to blow out
your brains to-night."</p>

<p>"Your wits are wandering; that's all," said
Cazeby, compassionately.</p>

<p>"Oh, far from it!" said Bibi-la-Raie, with a
short laugh. "But one does not fondle one's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>revolver in the daytime without a good reason,
nor does one leave it <em>on top</em> of letters postmarked
this morning unless one has been fondling
it&mdash;quoi?"</p>

<p>Cazeby was at the marqueterie desk in two
strides, tugging at the upper right hand drawer.
It was locked. He turned about slowly, and,
half seating himself on the edge of the desk,
surveyed his guest coolly.</p>

<p>"The revolver is in your pocket," he said.</p>

<p>"No," answered Bibi, with an air of cheerfulness.
"I have one of my own. But the key
is."</p>

<p>"Why?" said Cazeby.</p>

<p>Bibi helped himself to yellow chartreuse, and
appeared to reflect.</p>

<p>"I am not sure that I know why, myself,"
he said finally. "Perhaps, because you have
done me a kindness and I would not like to
have you burn your fingers in a moment of absent-mindedness.
Perhaps, because we might
disagree, and I should not care to take the
chance of your shooting first!"</p>

<p>He squinted at the liqueur, swallowed it
slowly and with extreme appreciation, smacked
his lips, and then, cocking his feet up on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>Cazeby's brass club fender, began to smoke
again, staring into the dwindling fire. His
host watched him in silence, until he should
be ready to speak, which he presently began
to do, with his cigarette drooping from the corner
of his month and moving in time to his
words. He had suddenly and curiously become
a man of the world&mdash;of the grand monde&mdash;and
his speech had shaken off all trace of
slang, and was tinged instead with the faint
club sarcasm which one hears in the glass card-room
of the Volney or over coffee on the roof
of the Automobile. Moreover, it was beautiful
French. Not Mounet himself could have done
better.</p>

<p>"The only man to whom one should confide
personal secrets," said Bibi-la-Raie, "is
he whom one has never seen before and will,
as is probable, never see again. I could tell
you many things, Monsieur Cazeby, since that
is your name,&mdash;I have seen your morning's
mail, you know!&mdash;but, for the moment, let it
suffice to say that the voyou who accosted you
this evening is of birth as good as yours&mdash;pardon,
but probably better! <em>Wein, weib, und
gesang</em>&mdash;you know the saying. Add cards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>and the race-course, and you have, complete,
the short ladder of five rungs down which I
have been successful in climbing. I shall presume
to the extent of supposing that you have
just accomplished the same descent. One learns
much thereby, but more after one has reached
the ground. In many ways I am afraid experience
has made me cynical, but in one it has
taught me optimism. I have found, and I think
I shall continue to find, that there is always
something worth looking into around the next
corner of even the darkest street. The rue
des Sablons, for instance. It was very dark
to-night, very damp, and very cold. Assuredly,
as I turned into the avenue d'Eylau I had no
reason to foresee a supper, Russian cigarettes,
and chartreuse jaune. And yet, me voilà! Now
what most of us lack&mdash;what you, in particular,
seem to lack, Monsieur Cazeby&mdash;is the tenacity
needful if one is to get to that next turning."</p>

<p>"There are streets darker than the rue des
Sablons," put in Anthony, falling in with the
other's whimsical humor, "and that have no
turning."</p>

<p>"You speak from conjecture, not experience,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>said Bibi-la-Raie. "You can never have
seen one."</p>

<p>He glanced about the room, with the air of
one making a mental inventory.</p>

<p>"First," he added, "there come the pawnshop,
the exterior boulevards, the somewhat
insufficient shelter of the Pont Royal. No,
you have not come to the last corner."</p>

<p>"All that," said Cazeby, "is simply a matter
of philosophy. Each of us has his own idea
of what makes life worth the while. When
that is no longer procurable, then that is the
last corner."</p>

<p>"For instance&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"For instance, my own case. You have analyzed
my situation sufficiently well&mdash;though
when you said I was about to blow out my
brains"&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was a mere guess," interrupted Bibi,
"founded on circumstantial evidence. Then
I <em>thought</em> so. Now I <em>know</em> it."</p>

<p>"Let us grant you are right," continued
Cazeby, with a smile. "I have my own conception
of what I require to make existence
tolerable. It includes this apartment, or its
equivalent, a horse, two servants, two clubs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>and a sufficient income to dress, eat, entertain,
and amuse myself in the manner of my class,&mdash;an
extravagant and unreasonable standard,
if you will, but such is my conviction. Now,
granted that the moment has come when it
is no longer possible for me to have these
things, and when there is no prospect of my
situation being bettered, I cannot conceive
what advantage there can be in continuing to
live."</p>

<p>"I perceive you are a philosopher," said the
other. "How about the religious view?"</p>

<p>Cazeby shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"As to that," he said, "my religious views
are, so far as I know, stored away in the little
church which I was forced to attend three times
on every Sunday of my boyhood. They did
not come out with me on the last occasion, and
I have never met them since."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said Bibi. "It is the same
with me. But I think you are mistaken in your
conviction of what makes life worth living. I
had my own delusions in the time. But I have
had a deal of schooling since then. There are
many things as amusing as luxury&mdash;even on
the exterior boulevards. Of course, actual experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>is essential. One never knows what
one would do under given conditions."</p>

<p>He turned suddenly, and looked Cazeby in
the eye.</p>

<p>"What, for example, would you do if you
were in my place?" he asked.</p>

<p>"As you say, one never knows," said his
host. "I <em>think</em> that, in your place, I should
improve the opportunity you find open, and
carry out your late and laudable intention of
robbing Monsieur Antoine Cazeby. I may
be influenced by my knowledge that such a
proceeding would not irritate or incommode
him in the least, but that is what I think I
should do.</p>

<p>"I shall not need these things to-morrow,"
he added, indicating his surroundings with a
gesture. "You were quite right about the
pistol. As to your prospective booty, I regret
to say that I spent my last sixty centimes
on our cognac, but there is a remarkably fine
scarf-pin on the table in my dressing-room."</p>

<p>"A sapphire, surrounded by black pearls,"
put in the other. "You were rather long in
cooking those eggs."</p>

<p>"A sapphire, surrounded by black pearls,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>agreed Cazeby. "Yes, upon reflection, I am
quite sure that that is what I should do."</p>

<p>Bibi-la-Raie smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I am glad to find we are of one mind," he
said. "Of course, mine was made up, but it
is more agreeable to know that I am causing
you no inconvenience. I suppose it is unnecessary
to add that resistance will be quite
useless. I have the only available revolver,
and, moreover, I propose to tie you into this
extremely comfortable chair. It is not," he
added, "that I do not trust you, although our
acquaintance is, unfortunately, too recent to
inspire complete confidence. No, I have my
convictions as well as you, Monsieur Cazeby,
and one of them, curiously enough, is that, in
spite of appearances, I am doing you a kindness
in putting it out of your power, for tonight,
at least, to do yourself an injury. Who
knows? Perhaps, in the morning, you may
find that there is something around the next
corner, after all. If not, there is no harm
done. Your servants come in early?"</p>

<p>"At seven o'clock," said Anthony, briefly.</p>

<p>"Exactly. And I will leave the key in the
drawer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>Bibi was expeditious. When he had bound
Cazeby firmly, and with an art that showed
practice, he disappeared into the dressing-room,
returning in less than a minute with
the sapphire scarf-pin and several other articles
of jewelry in his hand.</p>

<p>"I should like to add to these," he said,
going to the book-case, "this little copy of
Omar Khayyám. He is a favorite of mine.
There is something about his philosophy which
seems to accord with our own. But&mdash;'the bird
of time has but a little way to flutter'"&mdash;He
paused at the door.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you before I go?"
he inquired politely.</p>

<p>"Be good enough to turn off the light," said
the other. "The button is on the right of the
door."</p>

<p>"Good-night," said Bibi-la-Raie.</p>

<p>"Good-night,&mdash;brother!" said Cazeby.</p>

<p>Then he heard the door of the apartment
close softly.</p>

<p>Anthony was awakened from a restless sleep
by the sound of its opening. Through the
gap between the window draperies the gray
light of the winter morning was creeping in.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>His wrists and ankles were aching from the
pressure of the curtain cords with which he
had been bound, and he was gratified when,
after a brief interval, the salon door was opened
in its turn and the invaluable Jules came in, in
shirt-sleeves and long white apron, carrying
a handful of letters.</p>

<p>That impassive person was probably never
nearer to being visibly surprised. For a breath
he stopped, and the pupils of his round eyes
dilated like those of a cat in a dim light. But
his training stood him in good stead, and when
he spoke his voice was as innocent of emotion
as if he had been announcing dinner.</p>

<p>"Monsieur desires to be untied?"</p>

<p>Left to himself, Cazeby turned his attention
to his letters, and from the top of the pile
picked up a cablegram. He was still reflecting
upon the singular experience of the night,
in an attempt to analyze his present emotions.
Was he in any whit changed by his enforced
reprieve? He was glad to think not. Above
all minor faults he abhorred vacillation of
purpose. No, his situation and his purpose
remained unaltered. But he was conscious,
nevertheless, of an unwonted thrill at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>thought that, but for the merest chance, it
would have been for others to open the envelope
he was even now fingering. Jules
would already have found him&mdash;he wondered,
with the shadow of a smile, whether Jules
would still have been unsurprised!&mdash;and
would have brought up the concierge and the
police&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly the cable message jumped at him
through his revery as if, at that moment, the
words had been instantaneously printed on
what was before blank paper, and he realized
that it was from his father's solicitor.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Cazeby died eight o'clock this evening
after making will your favor whole property.
Waiting instructions.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Milliken.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Anthony straightened himself with a long
sigh, and, putting aside the curtain, looked out
across the mansardes, wet and gleaming under
a thin rain. His hand trembled a little on the
heavy velvet, and he frowned at it, and, going
across to the table, poured himself out a swallow
of brandy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>

With the glass at his lips he paused, his
eyes upon the chair where Bibi-la-Raie had
sat and wherein he himself had passed five
hours. Then, very ceremoniously, he bowed
and dipped his glass toward an imaginary occupant.</p>

<p>"Merci, monsieur!" he said.</p>

<h2><a id="The_Only_Son_of_His_Mother"></a>The Only Son of
His Mother</h2>

<p class="dropcap">IN the limited understanding of Pépin dwelt
one great Fact, in the shadow of which all
else shrank to insignificance, and that Fact
was the existence of Comte Victor de Villersexel,
the extremely tall and extraordinarily
imposing person who was, first of all, Officier
de la Légion d'Honneur, second, Membre de
l'Académie Française, and, lastly, father to
Pépin himself. It must be acknowledged that
to the more observing of his limited kinsfolk
and extensive acquaintance the clay feet of
Pépin's idol were distinctly in evidence. How
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>he had contrived to attain to the proud eminence
which he occupied was, in the earlier
days of his publicity, a matter of curious conjecture
and not over-plausible explanation.
Certainly no inherent merit or ability it was
which formed the first step of the stairway he
had climbed. In diplomacy the Comte de
Villersexel had never bettered his first appointment
as second secretary of legation at Belgrade;
in literature his achievements were
limited to one ponderous work on feudalism,
remarkable chiefly for its surpassing futility;
and in society his sole claim to consideration
lay in his marriage to a Brazilian heiress, who
had died within the year, leaving her husband
an income of two hundred thousand francs&mdash;and
Pépin. In all this it was difficult to find
a sufficient reason for the crimson button and
the green embroidered coat, unless it was that
the family of de Villersexel went back to the
Crusades. That is not always a prudent thing
for a family to do, but the present instance
was an exception.</p>

<p>Born to the heritage of a name which his
predecessors had made notable, Comte Victor
was one of those whose greatness is thrust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>upon them rather than achieved, one of the
bubbles in the ferment of Paris which their
very levity brings to the top, to show rainbow
tints in the sunlight of publicity. It is probable
that no one was more surprised than de
Villersexel himself at the honors which fell
to his share, but one thing even the most contemptuous
had, perforce, to concede. Once
secure of his laurels, he wore them with a
confidence that was akin to conviction. His
reserve was iron-clad, his dignity stupendous.
It required considerable time for new acquaintances
to probe the secret of his insufficiency.
Victor de Villersexel was, as the irreverent
young military attaché at the American Embassy
once said of him, "a dazzling imitation
of the real thing."</p>

<p>But to Pépin the idol was an idol without
flaw. Through what shrewd appreciation of
occasional words and chance comments he had
contrived to grasp the significance of that speck
of scarlet upon the Count's lapel and that apparently
simple phrase, "de l'Académie Française,"
which, in formal introductions, was wont
to follow his father's name, must be numbered
among childhood's mysteries. But before he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>was seven, Pépin had solved these problems
for himself, and the results of his reasoning
were awestruck admiration and blind allegiance
to the will of this wonderful creature
who never smiled. His own small individuality
was so completely overshadowed by that of his
father that in the latter's presence the child
was scarcely noticeable, dressed in his sober
blouses, and creeping about the stately rooms
of the great apartment in the avenue d'Iéna
with an absolutely noiseless step. He was all
brown, was Pépin: brown bare legs, and brown
hands, very small and slender, brown hair,
cropped short and primly parted, and deep
brown eyes, eloquent of unspoken and unspeakable
things. He was earnest, his tutor
said, earnest and willing, but not bright, poor
Pépin! He spoke English, to be sure, with a
curious accent caught from his Cornish nurse,
but that was due not so much to ability as to
enforced association. In his French grammar
and such simple arithmetic as was required of
him he was slow and often stupid. But he was
rarely scolded, and never punished. Once,
indeed, the Comte had been about to strike
him for some trifling fault, but somehow the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>blow, for which Pépin stood waiting, never
fell.</p>

<p>"He is like his mother," the légionnaire had
muttered, as he turned away, "an imbecile&mdash;but"&mdash;</p>

<p>Pépin, catching the unfinished phrase, grew
sick with a great discouragement, mingled with
profound pity for the man before him. It must
be a dreadful thing for one so famous to be the
father of an imbecile! From that day on the
child was more inconspicuous than before.</p>

<p>Deliberately affected in the first instance,
what was known in society as de Villersexel's
"academic manner" came in course of time
to be second nature. Practice made perfect
the chill reserve which was originally assumed
as a precaution against possible discovery of
his vapidity; and as the image of what the
academician had been, before his election,
grew dimmer in society's recollection, his impressive
solemnity, barely disguised by a veneer
of superficial courtesy, did not fail of its effect.
He was spoken of as a man in whom much lay
below the surface, and his more recent acquaintances
coupled their estimate of his character
with the proverbial profundity of still waters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>and the familiar gloved fist of steel. Others,
more observant, smiled at the similes, but did
not go to the pains of proving them ill applied.
One of the most characteristic things about
the Comte de Villersexel was that he inspired
neither championship nor antagonism.</p>

<p>With all this, he was consistent, with that
curious obstinacy which is sometimes made
manifest in the shallowest natures. His rôle,
once assumed, was, as we have said, played to
perfection and never laid aside. The domestic
threshold, which is, for the majority of men, a
kind of uncloaking room, saw never an alteration,
even of voice or expression, in his pose.
The household affairs were regulated with almost
military precision, and once a day, at
noon, Pépin and his father met in the large
salon,&mdash;the Comte in his tall satin stock and
frock coat, and Pépin fresh from the careful
hands of his nurse. They shook hands gravely,
and then waited in silence, until the maître
d'hôtel announced breakfast,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ces messieurs sont servis!"</p>

<p>What meals they were, to be sure, those déjeuners,
solemnly served, and more solemnly
eaten, under the rigid observation of three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>menservants; de Villersexel, with his thin lips,
his cold eyes, and his finely pointed gray mustache,
barely moving save to raise his fork or
break a morsel from his roll, and Pépin, all
brown, perched like a mouse on the edge of a
great chair, and nibbling at tiny scraps of food
with downcast eyes!</p>

<p>At the very end, as the Comte was about to
push back his chair, he would invariably raise
his glass of champagne and Pépin his, wherein
a few drops of red wine turned the Evian to
a pale heliotrope, and together they would
glance toward the full-length portrait which
hung above the mantel.</p>

<p>"Ta mère!" said the Comte.</p>

<p>"Maman!" replied Pépin.</p>

<p>And so they drank the toast of tribute to the
dead.</p>

<p>After breakfast, the father would read for
an hour to the child, and Pépin, seated on another
large chair, would listen, perfectly motionless,
striving desperately to understand the
long sentences which fell in flawlessly pronounced
succession from the Academician's
lips. De Villersexel had a fairly clear recollection
of what books had been the companions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>of his childhood, and these he purchased
in the rarest editions, and clothed in the richest
bindings, and read to Pépin: only his remembrance
did not extend to a very distinct
differentiation between seven and fifteen, for
it was at the latter age that he read "Télémaque"
to himself, and at the former that he
read "Télémaque" to his son.</p>

<p>Then would come a second formal handshake,
and Pépin, pausing an instant at the
door to make a slow, stiff bow, would creep off
down the long corridor to the nursery, and the
Comte turn again to his papers with a consciousness
of paternal duty done.</p>

<p>How Pépin contrived to spend the long
hours which his daily walk and his short lessons
left at his disposal, only Pépin knew. He
talked rarely with the servants,&mdash;"a thing,"
his father told him, "that no gentleman would
wish to do;" and other children never entered
at the de Villersexel door, "for," said
the Comte, "children sow unfortunate ideas
and spread disease."</p>

<p>But there were compensations. One was
the full-length portrait over the chimney-piece
in the dining-room. Pépin had no conception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>of how great was the signature it bore, or of
the fabulous sum which it had cost, but he
knew it was very beautiful, and, besides, it was
his mother,&mdash;the sad-eyed, pale dream-mother
he had never seen.</p>

<p>The portrait of the Comtesse de Villersexel
had been one of the sensations at the Salon of
seven years before. The young Brazilian was
represented at the moment when the bow left
the strings of her violin, and on her lips and in
her eyes yet dwelt the spirit of the music she
had been playing. A clinging gown of ivory-white
silk emphasized rather than hid the lines
of her figure, of strangely girlish slenderness,
but straight and proud as that of a young empress.
In its frailty lay the keynote of the
portrait's charm. It was like a reflection in
clear water that a touch might disturb, or a
young anemone that a breath might destroy,&mdash;not
a picture before which people disputed and
proffered noisy opinions, but one which imposed
silence, like the barely audible note of a
distant Angelus. It stood before the memory
of its original, as it had been a spirit, finger on
lip, at the doorway of a tomb.</p>

<p>This portrait of his mother dominated the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>life of Pépin like the half-remembered substance
of a dream. He had known nothing of
her in the life, for the breath of being had
passed from her lips to his at the moment of
his birth, but with the intuition of childhood,
he seemed to know that this was one who
would have loved him and whom he would
have loved. He spent hours before the picture,
silent, spell-bound, gazing into the deep
and tender eyes that shone with the same pathetic
pleading that lay so eloquently in his
own, and the only outbreak of rage which had
ever stirred his simple serenity was on one
occasion when his nurse had found him thus
absorbed, and, receiving no response to her
summons, half alarmed and half indignant, reproached
him with wasting his time before a
stupid picture. Then Pépin had whirled around
upon her, his lips compressed, his small brown
hands clenched, and a look in his eyes that
terrified even the stout and prosaic Cornish-woman
out of her accustomed attitude of fat
complacency.</p>

<p>"A stupid picture?" he stormed. "But it
is my mother, do you hear, my mother! You
are a wicked woman, Elizabeth!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>

It was when Pépin was nearing his seventh
birthday that a wonderful thing happened.
The Comte was giving a great reception to the
Russian Ambassador, and on an impulse which,
perhaps, even he himself could hardly have
explained, sent for his son. The child was
aroused from sleep, and, but half awake and
totally uncomprehending, was submitted by the
worthy Elizabeth to a veritable cyclone of washing,
combing, and brushing, and finally, clad
in spotless duck, was led by the maître d'hôtel
down the long corridor to the door of the grand
salon, which, at his approach, swung open under
the touch of one of the under servants.
Pépin, dazed by the radiance of many lights
and a great clamor of voices, paused on the
threshold, and, with a swift intuition of what
was demanded of him, made his slow, stiff bow.</p>

<p>"Le Vicomte de Villersexel," said the maître
d'hôtel in a loud voice at his side, and Pépin,
seeing his father beckon to him from the group
where he stood, slipped close to him through
the crowd, and was surprised to find that the
Comte took his hand in his, and bent forward
to say in a whisper,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are to hear Pazzini play the violin.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>That is why I sent for you. He was your mother's
teacher."</p>

<p>Like all that had gone before, what followed
was to Pépin like a dream&mdash;a beautiful dream,
never to be forgotten. A great hush had settled
upon the brilliant assemblage, for even in
Paris there are still things which society will
check its chatter to hear, and the tall, gray-bearded
man, consulting with the pianist over
there, was Pazzini, the great Pazzini, whose
services had been more than once commanded
by royalty in vain. De Villersexel had drawn
Pépin nearer to the piano in the brief interval,
and as the opening chords of the introduction
were struck, he found himself but a few feet
from the famous violinist, his hand still linked
in that of his father, his eyes fixed in wonder
upon this unknown man who had been his
mother's teacher.</p>

<p>The first low note of the violin fell upon the
silence like a faint, far voice, heard across a
wide reach of calm water, and, as the marvelous
melody swelled into the fullness of its
motif, something new and strange stirred in
Pépin's heart, mounted and tightened in his
throat, ran tingling to his finger-tips. Through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>his half parted lips the breath tiptoed in and
out, and his deep eyes grew every instant, could
he have known it, more like those of the picture
that he loved. So he stood entranced,
seeing, hearing nothing but Pazzini and Pazzini's
violin, till the sonata drew imperceptibly
toward its close. Like the child, the great
violinist seemed to be unconscious of all that
surrounded him. Slowly, tenderly, he led his
music through the last phrases, until he paused
before the supreme high sweetness of the final
note. How it was he could never have told,
but, in that infinitesimal fraction of time, the
training of years played him false. He knew
that his finger-tip slipped an incalculable atom
of space, but it was too late. The bow was on
the string, and the imperceptibly flatted note
swelled, sank, and died away, unrecognized, he
thought, with a throb of thankfulness, by any
save his master ear. And then&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>Ah-h!</em>" said Pépin.</p>

<p>The long ripple of applause drowned the
child's whisper, and for an instant the terror
in his heart grew still, believing his exclamation
unheard. Then it leaped to life again, for
Pazzini was looking at him, his bow hovering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>above the instrument like his mother's in the
picture. In the mysterious solitude of the
crowded room the eyes of these two met, each
reading the other's as they had been an open
book, and in Pépin's was the pain of a wounded
animal, and in Pazzini's a great wonder and sorrow,
as of one who has hurt without intention,
and mutely pleads for pardon.</p>

<p>As the applause ceased, the violinist turned
to the Comte, and pointed to Pépin with his
bow.</p>

<p>"Who is that child?" he asked.</p>

<p>The thaw in the de Villersexel's "academic
manner" had been but momentary. With the
renewed hum of conversation he was himself
again, pale, proud, and immovable.</p>

<p>"It is my son, Pépin," he replied, with stiff
courtesy. "How shall I thank you for your
playing? It was the essence of perfection, as
it has ever been, and ever will be."</p>

<p>But he could not know, as he turned away
with Pépin, that in his heart the violinist said,
"Her boy! I understand!"</p>

<p>The miracle of his summons to the salon
that night was not, as it appeared, the actual
climax of existence, for a new marvel awaited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>Pépin on the morrow. The doors of the dining-room
had barely slid together behind them when
the Comte turned to him.</p>

<p>"Yesterday was Christmas," he said.</p>

<p>Pépin made no reply. In fact, the stupor
which descended upon him at this infraction
of the usual routine of life effectually deprived
him, for the moment, of the power of speech.</p>

<p>"It was Christmas," repeated the Comte,
"and because of that you are invited to a&mdash;a&mdash;soirée
to-day. Do you know the English
children on the entresol?"</p>

<p>"I have seen them," faltered Pépin, "but
we have never spoken. You told me"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have changed my mind," broke in his
father. "Monsieur 'Ameelton"&mdash;stumbling
desperately over the English name&mdash;"has
asked me to let you visit them this afternoon,
and I have said yes to him. Elizabeth will
dress you. Now you may go."</p>

<p>Barely conscious that Pépin had added a
timid "Merci, papa!" to his customary bow,
de Villersexel turned to his writing-table, as
the door closed behind the little Vicomte, and,
unlocking a drawer, took therefrom a letter
which had come to him that morning, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>burying himself in his arm-chair, proceeded to
its careful reperusal. It was in the fine Italian
handwriting of Pazzini, and ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;This is to be at once a
confession and a prayer. What would you say
if I were to tell you that Pazzini&mdash;the flawless
Pazzini, as men are pleased to call me!&mdash;murdered,
yes, murdered last night's sonata by flatting
that wonderful final note? Oh, it was a
very little thing, and passed unnoticed, for they
are stupid, these wise people who listen to me,
and they did not hear. Even you, my poor
friend, even you could not detect that tiny flaw
that was a monstrous crime. No, of all who
listened, there were but two that understood
what I had done. I was one of these, and the
other was your son&mdash;Pépin.</p>

<p>Do you know what that means, Monsieur
le Comte de Villersexel? Do you understand
that it is but one ear in millions that is so
finely keyed that this minutest deviation could
wound it like the most utter discord? And I
wounded him, your Pépin. I saw it in his
eyes. Therefore I tell you&mdash;I, who know&mdash;that
he is a genius, a genius greater than his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>mother, and that, like her, he must be my
pupil. I have none other now. It shall be
the work of my old age to make him the greatest
violinist of his day. Give him to me, my
friend, if not for his own sake, then for hers!</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Pazzini.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Prime feature of all the year to the little
Hamiltons, on the entresol, was their Christmas
tree. It arrived in some unknowable way in
the corner of the grand salon on the morning
after Christmas, and, from the moment of its
advent, the doors were sealed, and only the
privileged world of grown-ups went in and out,
and could see the splendors within. Inch by
inch the hands of the tall clock in the antichambre
dragged themselves around successive
circles toward the hour of revelation, and, keyed
to the snapping point of frenzy, the slender
figure of George and the round, squat form of
John stood motionless before the inexorable
timepiece, awaiting the stroke of four. This
suspense was harrowing enough in itself, and
only made bearable by recourse to occasional
mad caperings up and down the hall, and
whoops of mingled ecstasy and exasperation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>What was worse was the delay in the arrival
of their guests. Later, the latter would be an
indispensable part of the festivities: just now
they were mere impediments in the path of
bliss. Even the grown-ups were more considerate,
and came on time. Well they might,
since they were granted immediate admission
to the enchanted room, and came out with
maddening accounts of what was to be seen
therein. They sat about the small salon, and
talked the stupid things of which they were so
fond of talking,&mdash;Hamilton, tall, straight, and
with an amused twinkle in his eyes, while he
watched his wife vainly endeavoring to calm
her sons as they foamed and pranced at the
sealed doors; Miss Kedgwick, who wrote
books, and invited boys to tea; Monsieur de
Bercy, who was odd because he spoke no English,
but who cut heads out of nuts and apples,
and drew droll pictures on scraps of paper;
Miss Lys, who played the piano for "Going to
Jerusalem;" and Mr. Sedgely, who talked very
low in her ear, and said the great trouble with
"Going to Jerusalem" was that the players
couldn't go there in good earnest&mdash;whatever
that might mean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>

But would the doors <em>never</em> open?</p>

<p>The children arrived by twos and threes,
shook hands limply with their elders, greeted
their small hosts with embarrassed ceremony,
and then, as if suddenly inoculated with the
latter's madness, commenced to foam and
prance in their turn before the unyielding
portals. Last of all came Pépin, all brown,
who bowed at the door, and then in turn to
each of those who spoke to him.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a shout, the children burst
through the opened doorway, and gathered in
voluble groups about the glistening miracle
which shone like a hundred stars in the gathering
twilight. For a half hour all was chaos,
and Pépin, standing a little apart, marveled
and was still. Dancing figures whirled about
him, bearing boxes of soldiers, toy villages,
dolls, trumpets, drums. The air was full of
the wailing of whistles, the cries of mechanical
animals, and the clamor of childish comment.</p>

<p>But to Pépin even the dazzling novelty of
his surroundings was as nothing, compared
to one object which drew and fixed his attention
from the first instant, as the needle is held
rigid by the magnetic pole. High up upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>tree, clearly outlined against its background
of deep green, and gleaming gorgeously with
fresh varnish in the light of the surrounding
candles, hung a violin&mdash;not one like Monsieur
Pazzini's, large and of a dull brown, but
small&mdash;a violin for Pépin himself to hold,
and new, and bright, and beyond all things
beautiful and to be desired!</p>

<p>Then his attention was distracted for a moment.
From the time of his entrance the eyes
of Miss Lys had followed the dignified and
silent little Frenchman, and where Miss Lys
went Mr. Sedgely followed, so that now the
two were so close that they brushed his elbow,
and Pépin, turning with an instinctive "Pardon,"
saw that they were watching him curiously.
When, with a feeling of restlessness
under their scrutiny, he looked once more
towards the tree, the violin was gone! An
instant later, he saw it in the madly sawing
hands of George Hamilton, dancing like a
faun down the room, and he was conscious of
a great faintness, such as he had known but
once before,&mdash;when he had cut his hand, and
the doctor had sewed it, as Elizabeth sewed
rips in cloth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>

"He is adorable," said Ethel Lys, "but I
have never seen a sadder face. What eyes!&mdash;two
brown poems."</p>

<p>"He makes my heart ache," answered
Sedgely, slowly, "and yet I could hardly say
why. Ask him what he wants off the tree."</p>

<p>The girl was on her knees by Pépin before
the phrase was fairly finished.</p>

<p>"What didst thou have for Christmas?" she
asked, falling unconsciously into that tender
second singular which slips so naturally from
the lips at sight of a French child.</p>

<p>"I?&mdash;but nothing," replied the little Vicomte,
pleased out of his anguish by the sound
of his own tongue amid the babel of English
phrases.</p>

<p>The girl at his side looked at him with so
frank an astonishment that he felt it necessary
to explain.</p>

<p>"I have my gifts on the day of the year.
Christmas is an English fête, and I am French.
So I have nothing."</p>

<p>"Nothing!" replied Miss Lys blankly, and
then, of a sudden, slipped her arm around him,
and drew his head close to her own.</p>

<p>"What dost thou see on the tree that thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>wouldst like to have?" she asked, eagerly.
"What is there, dearest?"</p>

<p>And, at the unwonted tenderness of her
question, the floodgates of Pépin's reserve
suddenly gave way. Placing his hands upon
the girl's shoulders, he searched her face with
his eyes.</p>

<p>"If there were another violin"&mdash;he began,
and, faltering, stopped, and turned away to
hide the tears that would come, strive as he
might to hold them back.</p>

<p>"Did you <em>hear</em> him&mdash;and <em>see</em> him?" queried
Miss Lys, a minute after, furiously backing
Sedgely into a corner by the lapels of his frock
coat. "You <em>did</em>&mdash;you <em>know</em> you did! And
you are still here? Lord! <em>What</em> a man!"</p>

<p>Sedgely shrugged his shoulders with a pretense
of utter bewilderment.</p>

<p>"What must I do?" he inquired, blankly.</p>

<p>"<em>Do?</em>" stormed Miss Lys. "<em>Do?</em> Why,
scour Paris till you find a violin precisely like
that one George is doing his best to saw in
half. Here! Clément is at the door with the
trois-quarts. Tell him to drive you like mad
to the Printemps&mdash;to the big place opposite
the Grand Hotel&mdash;to the Louvre&mdash;to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>Bon Marché&mdash;anywhere&mdash;everywhere! But
inside of one hour I must have that violin!"</p>

<p>When Sedgely returned, thirty minutes later,
violin in hand, Ethel met him at the door.</p>

<p>"They are all at tea," she said. "We'll
call Pépin out."</p>

<p>She placed the violin in the hands of the
Vicomte without a word, and without a word
Pépin took it from her. The instrument slid
to his cheek as if impelled by its own desire.</p>

<p>"Canst thou play?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"No," said Pépin, "and, besides, it is but a
toy. I do not want to hear it. But I like to
feel it&mdash;here." And he moved his cheek caressingly
against the cheap varnish.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you might"&mdash;began
Sedgely, and then found himself on the other
side of the door, and Miss Lys facing him with
an air of hopeless resignation.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;act-u-ally&mdash;be-lieve," she said, with an
effort at calm, "that you were going to ask him
to thank me for it!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Sedgely.</p>

<p>"<em>Lord!</em> What a man!" said Miss Lys.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the dining-room of the de Villersexel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>apartment the Comte paced slowly to and fro,
with bent head, and fingers that locked and
unlocked behind his back. In the heavy chair
before the fire, Pazzini seemed shrunk to but
half his normal size, a mere rack of clothes,
two lean white hands, that gripped the dragons'
heads upon the arms of the fauteuil, and
a pale stern face that looked into the smouldering
embers, and beyond&mdash;immeasurably
beyond.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" he asked, after a
time.</p>

<p>"Shall I ever know?" broke out de Villersexel
irritably. "Pépin had been to a children's
party below there on the entresol, at the
English lawyer's. He and his imbecile of a
bonne were entering the ascenseur. She goes
from spasm to spasm, so there is no telling.
But it seems they had given Pépin a toy&mdash;the
English&mdash;and she wished to carry it and he
refused. So between them&mdash;God knows how!&mdash;it
slipped from their hands as the ascenseur
cleared the gate&mdash;and Pépin stooped to catch
it&mdash;and fell. He died at midnight."</p>

<p>There was a long silence, broken only by the
snapping of the logs in the fireplace and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>almost inaudible footfalls of the Comte on the
thick carpet. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"He was his mother's son," said Pazzini.</p>

<p>"And mine," replied the other. "The last
of the de Villersexel."</p>

<p>He paused abruptly by a little table, and
took up a handful of splintered wood and tangled
catgut.</p>

<p>"The toy that killed him," he added in a
low voice, and hurled the fragments over Pazzini's
shoulder into the embers. A thin tongue
of flame caught at them as they fell, and broke
into a brilliant blaze. Pazzini leaned forward
suddenly and peered at the little conflagration.</p>

<p>"A violin," he said.</p>

<p>"A violin," echoed the Comte. "Think of
dying for a violin!"</p>

<p>Pazzini made no reply. His eyes had met
those of the portrait over the chimney&mdash;and
he was smiling.</p>

<h2><a id="The_Tuition_of_Dodo_Chapuis"></a>The Tuition of
Dodo Chapuis</h2>

<p class="dropcap">THE situation was best summed up in the
epigram of little Sacha Vitzoff, the second
secretary at the Russian Embassy,
who said that there was room enough in Paris
for two and a half millions of people <em>and</em> Gabrielle
de Poirier, or for two and a half millions
of people <em>and</em> Thaïs de Trémonceau, but
that even the place de la Concorde was not
sufficiently wide for Gabrielle and Thaïs to
pass without treading on each others' toes.</p>

<p>It was a rivalry of long standing, nourished
by innumerable petty jealousies and carefully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>treasured affronts. Gabrielle was tall and very
slender, with a clear, pale complexion, and hair
of a curious dark bronze that in certain lights
showed a hint of olive green. So Thaïs called
her the Asparagus Woman&mdash;la Femme Asperge.
Thaïs was short and anything but slim,
and brown of hair, eyes, and skin. So Gabrielle
called her the Mud-Ball&mdash;la Boule de
Boue. And neither appellation was pleasing
to the object thereof.</p>

<p>These two great luminaries of the Parisian
demi-monde, blazing crimson with mutual jealousy,
followed, for six months of the year, a
kind of right-triangular orbit, comprising the
restaurant of Armenonville, the race-course of
Auteuil, and the Café de Paris, and embracing
divers other points of common interest,&mdash;the
Palais de Glace, of a Sunday afternoon, the
tea-room of the Elysée Palace Hotel, the Folies-Marigny,
the Salon, and the Horse-Show;
and, individually, Gabrielle's apartment on the
avenue Kléber, and Thaïs's little hôtel on the
rue de la Faisanderie. Between the last two,
as regards situation, cost, and general equipment,
there was not a straw's weight of difference,
save in the estimation of their respective
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>occupants. The apartment had been rented
for a term of years, and furnished and decorated,
and supplied with four servants, by a
Russian millionaire, and the same was true of
the hotel in every, save one, detail,&mdash;the de
Trémonceau's millionaire was a Brazilian. For
the rest, Gabrielle was of a literary bent, and
wrote occasional feuilletons for the Journal,
and short stories, staggering with emotion, for
the Gil Blas Illustré: something which, in the
opinion of Thaïs, was stupid and all there was
of the most ignoble. Thaïs herself was a sporadic
feature at the Folies-Bergère, where she
sang songs of a melody and a propriety equally
doubtful, bunching up her silk skirts at the end
of the refrain, with her side toward the audience,
and winking, with brazen effrontery, at a
spot midway between the heads of the bald
gentleman in the third row and the wide-eyed
little St. Cyrien across the aisle. The which
Gabrielle found to be the trade of a camel.</p>

<p>Each had her horses, and her carriage, in
which she was whirled three times up and three
times down the allée des Acacias each noon of
the season, and again at five o'clock, and each
spent hours daily in the rue de la Paix, trailing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>long skirts of tulle and satin before the mirrors
of the men-milliners, and pricing strings of
pearls in the private offices of servile jewelers.
Each was deftly veneered, as it were, with the
bearing of the grande dame, except at the
moment when she chanced to pass the other,
or refer to her in the course of conversation.
Then the irrepressible past came suddenly to
the fore in a word or a gesture, which babbled
of Gabrielle's early experience in the workroom
of the very Paquin she was now patronizing,
and of Thaïs's salad days as assistant to
a florist on the grand boulevards.</p>

<p>Honors were even between the two when
Dodo Chapuis first came up to pay homage to
the queen capital, of which he had been dreaming
for four years. He was only nineteen, the
son of a great manufacturer of Arles, who had
lived severely and frugally, and, dying a widower,
left a cool half million of francs to be
divided between Dodo and his sister Louise.
There seems to have been no trace of doubt
in the mind of either as to the respective uses
to which their dazzling inheritances should be
applied. Louise promptly accepted a young
playwright with a record of fourteen rejected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>revues, to whose suit her father had been most
violently opposed; and Dodo, as promptly,
took out a letter of credit for fifty thousand
francs and departed for Paris on the morning
following the funeral.</p>

<p>The story of Dodo's first six weeks in the
capital is the story of full a million of his
kind. A pocket filled with gold and a mind
emptied of responsibility; youth, health, and
craving for the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge,&mdash;these
foundations given, the aspect of the
structure erected thereupon is inevitable.</p>

<p>Dodo made his début at the Moulin Rouge at
eight o'clock on the evening of his first day in
Paris. Despite appearances, this did not mean
that he was wholly a fool. One must remember
that it was the evening of the first day. He
walked leagues, it seemed to him, around the
crowded promenade, half stifled by an atmosphere
composed of equal parts of stale beer,
cigarette smoke, and cheap perfumery. He
watched a quadrille made up of shrill shrieks,
rouge, and an abundance of white lace. He
tossed balls into numbered holes in a long
board, and won a variety of prizes of pseudo-Japanese
make, which he immediately presented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>to the exponents of the aforesaid quadrille.
He squandered a louis in firing a rifle
at paper rabbits passing in monotonous succession
over three feet of sickly green hillside.
He bought a citronade for a girl with blue eyes,
and a menthe glaciale for another with brown;
and, at the end, rebuffing the proffered services
of a guide, who, by reason of his new tan overcoat,
and to his intense disgust, addressed him
in English, he returned to the Hôtel du Rhin
in a state of profound despondency.</p>

<p>But that, as we have said, was on his first
evening. On the third, he had engaged a table
in advance at Maxim's, and supped in state on
caviar, langouste à l'Américaine, and Ruinart.
<em>And</em> with Antoinette Féria. It was not much
of an achievement, but it showed progress.</p>

<p>On the following day Dodo went to Auteuil,
won twelve francs fifty on a ten-franc bet, and
dined at Armenonville. It was here that Suzanne
Derval looked cross-eyed at him, fingered
her pearls, and remarked that he had
beaux yeux. Dodo might be said to be fairly
launched.</p>

<p>It would be superfluous to note the further
stages of his initiation. They were strictly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>conventional, and, under the circumstances,
it was remarkable that, at the end of six weeks,
he had drawn but seven thousand francs on his
letter of credit, and still retained his enthusiasms.
It is not every one from the provinces
for whom Paris reserves her supreme surprise
for the forty-third day.</p>

<p>It chanced to be the first evening of the de
Trémonceau's annual engagement at the Folies-Bergère,
and for three days the eloquent legend
"La Belle Thaïs" had been glaring at the
boulevard throngs in huge block letters from
the posters on the colonnes Morris. Dodo,
meanwhile, had made many friends among men
of tastes similar to his own&mdash;a feat which is
curiously easy of accomplishment in Paris,
when one has forty-odd thousand francs and
a desire for company. Of these was Sacha
Vitzoff, who, on occasion, had five louis, and
invariably spent them at once upon his friends,
before he should be tempted to put them to a
worse use.</p>

<p>So Sacha bought the box, and they sat, five
of them, through two hours of biograph, and
trained dogs, and Neapolitan ballet, until the
liveried attendants thrust cards bearing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>number 19 into rococo frames at the side of
the proscenium, and the orchestra plunged into
Sarasate's "Zapateado," and various stout gentlemen
wrestled with mechanical devices for
supplying opera-glasses, and, conquering, sat
back in their seats and grunted. Then the
drop rose upon a pale pink and gray libel on
Versailles, and La Belle Thaïs flashed out from
the wing, with a red silk scarf bound about her
head and a toreador's hat perched on one side.</p>

<p>There was no denying it. Despite her rouge,
despite her four decades (an eternity in Paris),
La Thaïs was very beautiful. Dodo forgot his
cigarette, his champagne, and his companions.
He followed every swish of her spangled skirts,
every click of her castanets, every tap of her
pointed shoes, every movement of her gleaming
shoulders and her lithe, white arms. This,
then, was the reality of his dream, the soul and
substance of his vision, the essence of the
great city that had drawn him like a magnet
from his humdrum bourgeois life in the suburbs
of Arles,&mdash;the ineffable, eternal Woman,
poured like oil upon the smouldering fire of
boyish imagination! His slender hands gripped
the plush of the box-rail feverishly, his eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>widened and brightened, his lips parted, and
his breath came short. Then, suddenly, there
was a final clash of tambourines and castanets
which brought La Belle Thaïs to a standstill,
her head flung back, and one arm high in air!</p>

<p>"She has charm&mdash;even now!" said Sacha,
emptying his glass.</p>

<p>Three days later, it was known to all the
world that concerns itself with such things that
Dodo Chapuis was latest in the train of victims
to the fascinations of Thaïs de Trémonceau.
One cannot pretend to say what she saw in him
to divert her attention from richer and maturer
men. He was handsome&mdash;yes&mdash;but the
Comte d'Ys was handsomer. He was rich,
as such things go, and for the moment. But
he had no wit, poor Dodo&mdash;and as for money,
which, after all, is the only other thing which
counts in the demi-monde, what were forty thousand
francs to one authorized to draw, <em>ad libitum</em>,
upon a Brazilian multi-millionaire? No,
evidently, it was one of those strange whims to
which the slaves of self-interest are sometimes
subject. The de Trémonceau had nothing to
gain, and everything to lose, for, certainly, her
Brazilian miché would have been ill pleased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>to know that Dodo Chapuis was riding daily
six times up and six times down the allée des
Acacias in the victoria of La Belle Thaïs. As
it chanced, he was in Buenos Ayres. Still,
he might return without warning. He had an
ignoble habit of doing that. But when those
sufficiently intimate suggested this to Thaïs
she only laughed, and sang a snatch from La
Belle Hélène:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"<em>Si par mégarde il se hasarde</em></div>
<div class="i2"><em>De rentrer chez lui tout à coup,</em></div>
<div class="i0"><em>Il est le maître, mais c'est, peut-être,</em></div>
<div class="i2"><em>Imprudent et de mauvais goût!</em>"</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>As for Dodo, he was in Elysium. He was
singularly innocent, Dodo, with his smooth
russet hair, and his steady gray eyes, and his
straight, fine nose, and his sensitive, patrician
mouth; and, believe it or not as you will, he
cherished the project of marrying Thaïs de
Trémonceau! He had fed himself on the
poetry of Alfred de Musset, giving doubtful
words and phrases his own interpretation, from
lack of experience, and, despite the lesson of
"Don Paez" and "La Nuit d'Octobre," he
believed in the power of trust to hold another
true. Alas, he was hopelessly conventional!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>There is no one of us poor moths who is content
with seeing his fellow singe his wings.
No, each must plunge into the radius of consuming
heat and learn its peril for himself.
All of which is, no doubt, a wise ruling. For
if experience could be handed down from
father to son, and accepted on its face value,
then the child of the third or fourth generation
would be a demi-god, or even a full one,
and there would be no further attraction in
heaven, and no further menace in hell. The
which morsel of morality may be allowed to
pass, if only for contrast's sake. We were
speaking of Thaïs de Trémonceau.</p>

<p>Dodo's Elysium lasted longer than such
mirages are wont to do. For a full month he
basked in the sultry sunshine of the de Trémonceau's
smiles, dined almost nightly in the
rue de la Faisanderie, occupied a fauteuil at
the Folies while she whisked her spangled skirts
and sang "Holà! Holà!" to Sarasate's music,
supped with her afterwards at the Café de Paris
or Paillard's, and paid the addition, and tipped
the garçon, and the maître d'hôtel and the chef
d'orchestre, as liberally as if he had had a million
francs instead of a dwindling twenty thousand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>And the delirium might have lasted even
longer had it not been for Louise Chapuis.</p>

<p>No one ever knew who told. There is a wireless
telegraphy in such cases which defies detection.
Suffice it to say that, one morning,
the Hôtel de Choiseuil numbered Mademoiselle
Chapuis among its guests, and that, as
this name was inscribed upon the register,
the Fates rang up the curtain on the final act
of the brief comedy of the tuition of Dodo
Chapuis.</p>

<p>Where, when, and how Louise contrived, in
three days of Paris, to strike, full and firm-fingered,
the keynote of the situation remained
a mystery which none of those concerned was
capable of solving. In all the capital there was
but one person competent to deal conclusively
with the situation. That person was Gabrielle
de Poirier, and to Gabrielle de Poirier Louise
Chapuis applied.</p>

<p>There could have been no stranger meeting
than this between the young Arlésienne, with
her blue eyes, and her embarrassed hands, and
her gown that all the plage turned to look at,
because it was in the fashion of more than
yester-year, and the cold, stately leader of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>demi-monde, with her air of languid ease, her
shimmer of diamonds, and her slow, tired voice,
roused to interest for the moment by this singularly
sudden and imperative demand upon her
good-will and ingenuity.</p>

<p>Louise found Gabrielle half buried among
the cushions of a great divan, with a yellow-backed
novel perched, tent-like, upon her knee.
For once, the demi-mondaine was alone, bored
to extinction by the blatant ribaldry of Octave
Mirbeau. She had fingered the simply-lettered
card of her unknown visitor for a full minute,
before bidding her valet-de-pied admit her. A
whim, a craving for novelty&mdash;who knows
what? The Open Sesame had been spoken,
and now, in the half-light of late afternoon, her
caller stood before her.</p>

<p>"Be seated," said Gabrielle courteously.
"Be seated, Ma&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;Demoiselle," replied Louise, complying
with the invitation.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause. Each woman
studied the other curiously. Then Louise began
to speak, at first timidly.</p>

<p>"You think it strange, no doubt, madame,
this visit of mine. Let me be quite candid.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>I come to ask a favor of you&mdash;I, who have no
right, save the right of one woman to crave
assistance from another. I have a brother"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Faith of God!" said Gabrielle, lightly, "so
have I. A poor sample, if you will!"</p>

<p>Her flippancy seemed suddenly to lend
the other fresh courage. She leaned forward
eagerly, clasping her gray-gloved hands upon
her knee.</p>

<p>"But mine," she said, "is but a boy. He
has come to Paris, seeking to know the world,
and, lately, he has become the friend of Mademoiselle
Thaïs de Trémonceau."</p>

<p>"Zut!" put in Gabrielle. "You say well
that it is but a boy!"</p>

<p>"Is there need to tell you," continued Louise,
without heeding the sneer, "what this means
to me? Is there need to tell you what it means
to <em>him</em>?"</p>

<p>"My faith, no!" said Mademoiselle de
Poirier. "It is acquainted with me, that
story. The end is not beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Tout simplement," said her visitor, "I have
come to Paris to bring him back, to show him
the folly of his way. But I alone am powerless.
You&mdash;you who are more admired, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>beautiful, more clever than this Mademoiselle
de Trémonceau"&mdash;(Oh, Louise!)&mdash;"you
alone can aid me to rescue him."</p>

<p>Gabrielle raised her eyebrows slightly, and
let her lids droop with an air of unutterable
boredom.</p>

<p>"Truly, mademoiselle," she drawled, "I neither
see in what fashion I can assist you, nor
why, in any event, I should concern myself
with this affair. If your brother has such
taste"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, madame, I know I have no right,"
broke in Louise. "But you, of all women in
Paris, alone have the power to win him from
her."</p>

<p>"And when I have won him," demanded
Gabrielle, "what then? Do you think your
precious brother will fare better with me than
with the de Trémonceau?"</p>

<p>Her calm was broken for a moment by a
flash of anger.</p>

<p>"The world is full of fools," she added.
"One more or less is no great matter. I am
not a Rescue Society, mademoiselle. Let your
brother go his way. His best cure will be effected
by the woman herself. When his money
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>is gone, there will be no need to win him from
her."</p>

<p>The sneer sent the blood racing to the other's
cheeks. She had been counting, as she
realized with a pang of mortification, upon some
Quixotic quality which her reading had taught
lay always dormant, even in such a woman as
Gabrielle de Poirier,&mdash;some innate nobility,
ready to spring into activity at the bidding of
such an appeal as she had just made. And,
too, beneath all her anxiety, she had believed
that Thaïs loved her brother, that his peril lay
not so much in her making use of him and then
flinging him aside, as in the existence of actual
affection between him and a woman whom,
even as his wife, society would not recognize.
This brutal intrusion of money into the discussion,
this flippant classification of Dodo with
a world full of fools who flung away honor
and reputation for a passing fancy, only to be
flung away themselves in turn, suddenly seemed
to lay clear the whole situation, in all its sordid
vulgarity, and with the revelation came a
white rage against this woman who was only
another of the same kind. She despised herself
for having stooped to ask her aid, and a
fury of wounded pride blazed in her reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>

"You know yourself well, madame!" she
said. "No, surely my brother would fare no better
with you, though that was not what I meant
to ask. I thought, in my folly, that, perhaps,
in the life of such a one as you, there might
come moments when you longed to be other
than you are, moments when you would like to
think that among all the men you have played
with, ruined, and spurned, there were one or
two who could speak and think of you as men
speak and think of honest women, who could
say that you had been an ennobling influence
in their lives, and whose word would count
upon the side of good when you come to answer
for the evil you have done. I thought
that, not for money's sake or vanity's, you
might wish to win my brother from this woman,
and, when you had won him, teach him how
sordid, how wicked, how futile such a life is,
and send him back to decency&mdash;a better man!
I see how mistaken I was in judging you.
There is no compassion in you, no nobler instinct
than self-interest. Your motives are the
same as hers, love of admiration and love of
gold,&mdash;and, perhaps, less worthy. I cannot
say. Hers, at least, I can only suspect: yours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>I have had from your own lips. Had my brother
been more than the poor weak boy he is,
had he been brilliant, powerful, or a millionaire,
it would never have been necessary for me to
ask you to win him from her. No, madame,
for you would have done so of your own accord!"</p>

<p>Now, there is such a thing as diplomacy,
and there is such a thing as luck, and of the
former Louise Chapuis had not an atom. An
impulse, made apparently reasonable by pure
imagination, led her to seek out Gabrielle, and
had she found her, as her fancy had painted
her, readily moved by the appeal of honest affection
and confidence, she was competent to
have won her end. Louise was one of the people
who, in foreseeing a dispute, invent the replies
to their own questions, and who, if the
actual answers accord with those preconceived,
will emerge from the ordeal triumphant, but
who lack the diplomat's gift of adapting the
line of argument to that of unexpected retort.
Confronted with a state of affairs wholly different
from that which she had supposed existent,
her sole resource was in this outburst
of disappointment and reproach, honest, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>inutile as the clamor of a baffled baby. So
much for diplomacy.</p>

<p>But, as we have said, there is also such a
thing as luck. Gabrielle de Poirier was insufferably
bored. Her Russian was in Moscow,
her recent tips at Auteuil had proved disastrous,
her latest feuilleton had been rejected.
For six hours she had been buried among the
cushions of the divan, clad materially in light
pink but mentally in deepest blue, skipping
from page to page of a novel that was not
amusing, and confronted every ten minutes by
the recurrent realization that the next event
on her calendar was a dinner at the Café de
Paris, which would not come for the eternity
of twenty-seven hours! Despite her ungracious
reception of Louise, she had been grateful
for the diversion, and hardly had she
sneered at Dodo's position before she lit a
cigarette, and fell to studying the situation seriously.
Louise, pausing, breathless, after her
tirade, was surprised to find that she made no
reply, looking straight before her with her
great eyes half closed, and put down her silence
as equivalent to admission of the charges
hurled against her. The truth of the matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>was, however, that Gabrielle had not heard
one word of her visitor's impassioned denunciation!</p>

<p>There was a long silence, and then the demi-mondaine
looked up.</p>

<p>"Where does your brother live?" she asked,
touching an electric button at her side, "and
what is his first name?"</p>

<p>"At the Hôtel du Rhin," stammered Louise,
"and his name is Do&mdash;I should say Charles,&mdash;Charles
Chapuis. I am at the Hôtel de Choiseuil."</p>

<p>"Bon!" said the other. "If you will go
home, mademoiselle, and keep your own counsel,
I think I can promise you that you will
shortly have your brother back."</p>

<p>Louise stepped forward impulsively.</p>

<p>"Oh, madame!"&mdash;she began.</p>

<p>But just then the valet-de-pied appeared at
the door, and Gabrielle, taking up her novel,
flounced back among the cushions.</p>

<p>"Bon jour, mademoiselle," she said, without
looking at Louise. "Achille, la porte! And
send Mathilde to me."</p>

<p>The conference between mistress and maid
was brief but eloquent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>"Who," demanded Gabrielle, "is Dodo
Chapuis?"</p>

<p>"The young monsieur of Boule-de-Boue,"
responded Mathilde promptly.</p>

<p>"Parfaitement. I needed to refresh my
memory. And how long is it since we cabled
the last tuyau?"</p>

<p>"Eight weeks, at least, madame&mdash;before
the coming of Monsieur Chapuis."</p>

<p>"Bon!" said Gabrielle. "We cable another
tip at once."</p>

<p>(For it may be noted, in passing, that she
had one source of income which La Belle
Thaïs little suspected!)</p>

<p>"What does Boule-de-Boue do to-night?"
she demanded again.</p>

<p>"Dines at home with Monsieur Chapuis,"
replied the omniscient Mathilde, "dances at
the Fol' Berg' at eleven, sups at Paillard's with
Monsieur Chapuis."</p>

<p>(For it may also be noted, in passing, that
the maid of La Belle Thaïs had one source of
income which her mistress totally ignored!)</p>

<p>"Très bien!" said Gabrielle. "Now a pen
and paper, the inkstand, envelopes, sealing
wax, and a telegraph form, and write as I tell
thee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>For ten minutes Mathilde wrote rapidly, and
then spread the results of her exertions out
before her, in the shape of two notes and a
cablegram, and read them aloud triumphantly.
The first note was directed to Monsieur Charles
Chapuis, at the Hôtel du Rhin, place Vendôme:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If Monsieur Chapuis is a man of honor,"
it ran briefly, "he will break all engagements,
however important, for this evening, and present
himself chez Mademoiselle Gabrielle de
Poirier at seven o'clock, on a matter intimately
touching the good fame of his family.
The sister of Monsieur, Mademoiselle Louise
Chapuis, is chez Mademoiselle de Poirier."</p>

<p>The second note was addressed to Mademoiselle
Thaïs de Trémonceau, at 27 bis, rue
de la Faisanderie.</p>

<p>"A friend advises Mademoiselle Thaïs de
Trémonceau that Monsieur Charles Chapuis
dines with Mademoiselle Gabrielle de Poirier
this evening at half past seven."</p>

<p>And the cablegram was to Señor Miguel
Cevasco, Reconquista 21, Buenos-Ayres, République
Argentine.</p>

<p>"19 rides in the carriage of 52. 26."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>

The point of which observation lay in the
fact that Dodo confessed to nineteen, and
Señor Miguel to fifty-two, and Gabrielle to
twenty-six.</p>

<p>It was a bold play, and one foredoomed
to failure unless each link in the chain held
true. But Mademoiselle de Poirier was no
novice, and experience had long since taught
her that success is the child of audacity; so,
ten minutes later, Achille was speeding, in one
cab, toward the place Vendôme, pausing only
at the bureau de télégraphe on the corner of the
rue Pierre Charron and the avenue Marceau,
and Mathilde was speeding in another toward
the rue de la Faisanderie: and Gabrielle herself
was making life not worth living for Louis, her
long-suffering maître-d'hôtel.</p>

<p>The upshot of this triple commotion was
that, as the clock on her mantel struck seven,
Mademoiselle Gabrielle de Poirier was posing
on a chaise-longue in correct imitation of
David's "Madame Récamier," except for a
wonderful black gown, when Achille announced
Monsieur Charles Chapuis.</p>

<p>Dodo entered the room in immaculate evening
dress, but with a touch of embarrassment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>in his manner which betrayed his years. He
was good to look upon, was Dodo, tall, straight,
and slight, with the ruddy olive skin, the firm,
square fling of chest and shoulder, the narrowness
of waist, and the confident swing of
long, slender, but sinewy legs with which one
is blessed at nineteen in Bouches-du-Rhône.
Gabrielle, taking note of him from under her
covert, languid lids, was compelled, for once,
to mental candor.</p>

<p>"I comprehend Thaïs," she said to herself,
but to Dodo, "Monsieur, I felicitate you.
You have the true spirit of chivalry."</p>

<p>"My sister"&mdash;began Dodo.</p>

<p>"Is, no doubt, at the Hôtel de Choiseuil,"
answered Gabrielle, coolly, fanning herself.
"In any event she is not here. Oh, she <em>was</em>
here&mdash;yes; but she had gone&mdash;gone <em>before</em>
I sent you the note. Be seated, monsieur."</p>

<p>Dodo selected a chair, dropped into it, and
awaited developments in silence. Six weeks
before, he would have demanded in a passion
the meaning of this subterfuge. But whatever
might be said of La Belle Thaïs, one learned
diplomacy in her company.</p>

<p>"You are surprised, monsieur!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>

"I am infinitely surprised, madame," he
agreed, with charming candor.</p>

<p>"Shall we be frank with each other?" asked
Gabrielle, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I think it is the only way," said Dodo.
"Eh bien, I am infinitely surprised, madame;
first, to see my sister's name in connection with
yours at all, and, second, to find that you have
been lying to me."</p>

<p>"She came to ask me to rescue you from
the toils of Thaïs de Trémonceau."</p>

<p>Despite his elaborate self-control, Dodo
flushed crimson.</p>

<p>"I think we had best drop the discussion
here," he said, rising. "There can be no possible
profit in continuing it. If my sister was
here at all"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Her card is there on the table," put in
Gabrielle, pointing with her fan.</p>

<p>"Pardon. I should not have permitted myself
the insinuation. I accept your statement,
and simply say that it was an unwarrantable
intrusion on her part. For you, madame, I have
only admiration. Your compliance"&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was not that," said Gabrielle, shortly.
"I can conceive of nothing less important to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>me than your sister's wishes. But I dislike
Mademoiselle de Trémonceau."</p>

<p>"That," said Dodo, with exaggerated courtesy,
"can only be a matter of opinion. <em>I</em>
admire Mademoiselle de Trémonceau enormously."</p>

<p>"The force of admiration is undoubtedly
strong," snapped Gabrielle, "to reconcile you
to riding in another man's carriage, drinking
another man's wine, dawdling with another
man's"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Assez!" said Dodo.</p>

<p>Gabrielle shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Quite right," she said. "You are old
enough to see for yourself. I presume you
will not return to her."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I shall be with her in
fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>In the distance an electric bell whirred.</p>

<p>"Sooner than that, I think," smiled Gabrielle,
and then La Belle Thaïs was standing
at the salon door. She was gowned in scarlet,
with a poppy flaring in her hair, and, if she had
but lent to her dance at the Folies but half the
fury of that entrance, the manager would, no
doubt, have tripled her already ample salary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>And, at the instant of her appearance, as if
by signal,&mdash;which indeed it was,&mdash;Louis
flung wide the opposite door, with a stately
"Monsieur et madame sont servis," and there,
gleaming with spotless napery, silver shaded
candlesticks, and shimmering cut glass, was the
daintiest of tables, set for two!</p>

<p>What Thaïs did and what she said, this is
not the time or place to detail. She was not
wanting in vocabulary, the de Trémonceau, nor
sparing thereof in an emergency. A decade of
careful training fell from her like a discarded
mantle, and she became in an instant the vulgar-tongued
fleuriste of the boulevards. From
her chaise-longue Gabrielle smiled calmly, the
picture of a new Circe, rejoicing in the success
of her spells. And, between the two, Dodo,
his hands clenched until the knuckles shone
white, turned sick with contempt and loathing.
At the end Thaïs flung him an unspeakable
taunt, and there was a pause. Then,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you play the black or the red, monsieur?"
asked Gabrielle, sweetly, with a glance
at her own gown and another at the de Trémonceau's.</p>

<p>Dodo let his eyes run slowly, contemptuously,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>from the topmost ripple of her bronze
hair to the point of her satin slipper, with the
felicitous inspiration of seeming to take stock
of her charms and to be not over-pleased therewith.
Then,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I continue my game, madame!" he said.
"I play the red."</p>

<p>It was the last, faint cry of youthful chivalry,
disillusioned, blotted out, and it was wasted on
Thaïs de Trémonceau.</p>

<p>"Tu penses, salaud!" she broke in, with a
laugh. "Well, then, thou art well mistaken.
Rien ne va plus!"</p>

<p>"He will come back to me!" she cried to
her rival, as the door closed behind him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," agreed Gabrielle, "but only to
leave you again, in a fashion more mortifying
for him and more calamitous for you. I sent
a cable to Buenos Ayres this afternoon."</p>

<p>She was deliberately flinging away the aforementioned
source of income, for the sake of
seeing a certain expression on the face of La
Belle Thaïs. But when she saw it, she was
well content. For the honors were no longer
even.</p>

<p>On the avenue Kléber, Dodo hailed the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>cab that passed, and flinging a curt "Hôtel de
Choiseuil&mdash;au galop!" to the cocher, blotted
himself into one corner, and covered his face
with his hands.</p>

<p>"It was my first, but it shall be my last confidence
in woman," he said. It was neither
strictly original nor strictly true, this, but it
showed progress.</p>

<p>For there is such a thing as diplomacy and
there is such a thing as luck, and the fact that
his sister had not an atom of the former made
no difference whatever in the tuition of Dodo
Chapuis.</p>

<h2><a id="Le_Pochard"></a>Le Pochard</h2>

<p class="dropcap">HIS applicability was evident to the mind
of Jean Fraissigne from the moment
when the camelot placed Le Pochard
on a table in front of the Taverne, and he proceeded
to go through his ridiculous pretense
of drinking from the cup in his left hand which
he filled from the bottle in his right. Jean,
who was dawdling over a demi, and watching
the familiar ebb and flow of life on the Boul'
Miche', was at first passively pleased at the
distraction provided by the appearance of the
toy, and then, of a sudden, consumedly absorbed
in the progress of his operations. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>what was plain to any but a blind man was the
fact that Le Pochard was the precise counterfeit
of Jean's friend and comrade, Grégoire&mdash;Grégoire,
with his flat-brimmed hat, and his
loose working blouse, and his loud checked
trousers&mdash;Grégoire, hélas! with his flushed
face, and his tremulous hands, and his unsteady
walk, as Jean had seen him a hundred
times!</p>

<p>Le Pochard staggered to and fro upon the
marble-topped table, nodding maudlinly, and
alternately filling his cup and raising it uncertainly
to his expressionless face. At last, weakened
by his exertions, he passed one arm
through the handle of Jean's demi, hesitated,
and then leaned heavily against the glass and
stood motionless, with his topheavy head bent
forward, and his eyes fixed on the price-mark
upon the saucer below. This eloquent man&oelig;uvre,
so unspeakably appealing, determined the
future ownership of Le Pochard. Jean purchased
him upon the spot, and bore him off
in triumph to the rue de Seine, as an object
lesson for Grégoire Caubert.</p>

<p>The two students shared a little sous-toit
within a stone's throw of the Beaux-Arts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>neither luxuriously nor yet insufficiently furnished.
It was Jean's good fortune to have
a father who believed in him&mdash;not a usual
condition of mind in a provincial merchant
whose son displays an unaccountable partiality
for architecture&mdash;and, what was more to the
point, who could afford to demonstrate his confidence
by remittances, which were inspiring,
if not on the score of magnitude, at least on
that of regularity. And, since freedom from
pecuniary solicitude is the surest guarantee of
a cheerful spirit, there was no more diligent
pupil at the Boîte, no blither comrade in idle
hours,&mdash;above all, no more loyal friend, in sun
or shadow, throughout the length and breadth
of the Quartier, than little Jean le Gai, as he
was called by those who loved him, and whom
he loved.</p>

<p>That was why the comrades were at a loss
to understand his friendship for Grégoire Caubert.
Had the latter been one of themselves,
a type of the schools, in that fact alone, whatever
his peculiarities, would have lain a reason
for the association. But, to all intents and
purposes, he was of another world. His similarity
to Jean and to themselves began and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>ended with his costume. For the rest he was
silent and reserved, courting no confidence and
giving none, unknowing and unknown to the
haunts they frequented,&mdash;the Deux Magots,
the Escholiers, the Taverne, the Bullier, and
Madame Roupiquet's in the rue de Beaune,
and the Rouge on Thursday nights. Jean le
Gai, when questioned as to the doings of
Grégoire, seemed to reflect something of his
friend's reserve. He admitted that the other
wrote: he even went so far as to prophesy that
some day Grégoire would be famous. Further,
he made no admissions.</p>

<p>"Diable!" he said. "What does it matter?
He goes his way&mdash;I go mine. And if we
choose to live together, whose concern is it
then, I ask you? Fichez-moi la paix, vous
autres!"</p>

<p>So popular curiosity went unsatisfied, so far
as Grégoire was concerned, and the apparently
uncongenial ménage came, in time, to be looked
upon as one of the unexplained mysteries of
the Quartier,&mdash;one, for the rest, which made
no particular difference to any one save the two
immediately concerned.</p>

<p>But if Jean made no admissions as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>Grégoire, it was not for lack of sufficient
knowledge. They had met, as men meet in
the Quartier,&mdash;as bubbles meet in a stream,
and, for reasons not apparent, are drawn together
by an irresistible attraction, and fuse
into one larger, brighter bubble than either has
been before. For little Jean Fraissigne, whose
exquisses were the wonder of the School, and
whose projets had already come to be photographed
and sold in the shops of the rue
Bonaparte and the quai Conti, believed in his
heart that architecture was as nothing compared
to literature, and Grégoire, whose long,
uphill struggle had been unaccompanied by
comradely admiration or even encouragement,
found indescribable comfort, in the hour of his
success, in the faith and approbation of the
friend who alone, of all men, knew his secret,&mdash;knew
that the Réné de Lys of the "Chansons
de Danaé" and the "Voyage de Tristan"
of which all Paris was talking, was none other
than himself&mdash;Grégoire Caubert, on whose
wrist the siren of absinthe had laid a hand that
was not to be shaken off, and whom she was
leading, if by the paths of subtlest fancy and
almost miraculous creative faculty, yet toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>an end inevitable on which he did not dare to
dwell.</p>

<p>To Jean, healthy, rational, and cheerful as
a young terrier, much that Grégoire said and
did was totally incomprehensible, but what he
did not understand he set down, with conviction,
to the eccentricity of genius. The long
nights which he spent alone, sleeping sanely
in their bedroom in the rue de Seine, while
Grégoire's cot stood empty beside him, and
Grégoire himself was tramping the streets of
Paris; the return of his friend in the first faint
light of dawn, pale-faced and swaying; the
succeeding hours which, despite his exhaustion,
he spent at his desk, feverishly writing,
and tossing the pages from him, one by one,
until the floor was strewn with them on all
sides; finally, his heavy slumber far into the
afternoon,&mdash;all this, to Jean, was but part and
parcel of that marvelous thing called literature.
He returned at seven to find that Grégoire had
prepared a wonderful little meal, and was walking
up and down the floor, unevenly, absinthe
in hand, awaiting his arrival.</p>

<p>In the two hours which followed lay the
keynote of their sympathy. It was then that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>Grégoire would read his work of the early
morning hour, to Jean, curled up on the divan,
with his hands clasped behind his head and
his eyes round and wide with delight and admiration.
What things they were, those fancies
that Grégoire had pursued and caught,
like night-moths, in the streets of Paris, while
stupid folk were sleeping! And how he read
them, Grégoire, with his flushed face lit with
inspiration, and his eyes flaming with enthusiasm!
If only he would not drink absinthe,
thought little Jean, and said so, timidly at first,
and then more earnestly, as, little by little, the
marks of excess grew more plain in his friend.
But Grégoire made a joke of this&mdash;he who
always joked&mdash;and in time, Jean came to acquiesce.
For he never wholly understood&mdash;until
afterwards.</p>

<p>So, when nine struck, it was understood that
they parted company till the following evening.
Jean brought out his drawing board, his T
square, and all their attendant paraphernalia,
and toiled at his calques with infinite patience
and unerring accuracy, until midnight; and
Grégoire, having corrected his manuscript here
and there, gnawing savagely at his pencil the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>while, inclosed it in one of his long envelopes,
scrawled "Rédaction du Journal" upon it,
stamped it, and went out into the night to mail
the old, and seek new moths. And this was
all there was to the comradeship which mystified
the Quartier, save that the love of Jean for
Grégoire and of Grégoire for Jean was as deep
and unfaltering as the current of the eternal
Seine&mdash;and, if anything, more silent!</p>

<p>Jean wound up Le Pochard stealthily, on the
landing outside the apartment door, and, entering,
placed it suddenly upon the table under
the very nose of Grégoire, who stood, sipping
his absinthe, in the centre of the room. Le
Pochard rocked and swayed, ticking like a little
clock, and drinking cup after cup of his imaginary
beverage, as if his life depended upon the
quantity consumed. Convulsed with merriment
at the performance of the preposterous
creature, Jean le Gai lay prone upon the divan,
kneading the cushions with his fists and kicking
his heels against the floor, and Grégoire,
a slow smile curling his thin, sensitive lips,
seemed to forget even his absinthe until the
toy's energy slackened and he paused, with
the bottle shaking in his hand, and his eyes, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>usual, bent upon the ground. Then&mdash;"Eh
b'en&mdash;quoi?" said Grégoire, looking up at his
friend.</p>

<p>"Mais c'est toi!" burst out the little architect
in an ecstasy. "It is thou to the life,
my Grégoire! Remark the blouse&mdash;what?&mdash;and
the hat, sale pompier!&mdash;and the checked
grimpant, name of a pipe! But it is thy
brother, Le Pochard!&mdash;thy twin&mdash;thou, thyself!"</p>

<p>And seizing the glass from Grégoire's hand,
he carefully filled Le Pochard's cup with absinthe,
and set him reeling and swaggering
again, so that the immoral little animal spilled
the liquid on his blouse, and presently fell headlong,
totally overcome, with his nose pressed
flat against the table.</p>

<p>Thereafter, it was a comradeship of three
instead of two. It was quite in accord with
the whimsically fanciful nature of Grégoire
that he should take Le Pochard into his affections,
and even call him "brother" and "cher
confrère." He treated him, did Grégoire, with
marked deference and studied non-observance
of his besetting weakness, and he expected
and received from Le Pochard a like respect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>and indulgence in return. That, at least, was
how he described their relations to Jean, and
Jean, curled up upon the divan, was never tired
of the droll pretense, but would laugh night
after night till the tears came, at the common
tact and the mutual courtesy of Grégoire and
Le Pochard.</p>

<p>Linked by this new, if unstable, bond of
sympathy, neither of the friends understood,
during the months that followed, that their
paths, which had so long lain parallel, were
gradually but inevitably diverging. Jean was
now wrapped heart and soul in the competition
for the Prix de Rome, and, as he said himself,
en charrette eternally. Even the work of
his comrade, which formerly had held him
spell-bound, lost for him, little by little, much
of its compellant charm. His nimble mind,
busy with the stern, symmetrical lines of columns
and the intricate proportioning of capitals,
drifted imperceptibly away from its one-time
appreciation of pure imagery. He returned
later at night from the atelier, consumed the
meal they ate in common with growing impatience,
and was busy with his calques again
before Grégoire had fairly finished his coffee.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>The evening readings, grown shorter and
shorter, were finally abandoned altogether,
and, oftener than not, Jean was totally oblivious
to the presence of Grégoire, correcting his
manuscript at the little desk, or his noiseless
departure with the stamped envelope under
his arm. Had he been told, he would have
denied his defection with the scorn bred by
conviction. It was not that he loved his comrade
less, but only that the growing promise
of the Prix de Rome lay, like the marvel of
dawn, on the horizon of the immediate future,
blinding his eyes to all beside. For Jean le
Gai was finding himself, and in the crescent
light of that new and wonderful discovery whatever
had been bright before grew tawdry.</p>

<p>Only one evidence remained of what had
been. Le Pochard, with his absurd inanity,
was yet a feature of every dinner in the rue de
Seine, and because Grégoire invented daily
some new drollery in connection with their
senseless toy, Jean was unaware that things
were no longer the same,&mdash;that his friend
was thinner and more nervous, that the circles
had deepened under his eyes, that he said
no word of his work. They laughed together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>at Le Pochard, and laughed again at their own
amusement. So the days went by and still
their paths diverged,&mdash;Jean's toward the sungilt
hills of promise and prosperity, Grégoire's
toward the valley of shadow that a man must
tread alone.</p>

<p>Despite his proclivities, neither foresaw the
end of Le Pochard. So gradual was his decline
toward utter degradation that the varnish
was gone from his narrow boots and his round,
weak face, and his simple attire was frayed and
worn, before they had remarked the change.
Then, one night, as Grégoire wound him, the
key turned futilely in the spring. Placed in his
accustomed position on the table, Le Pochard
made one feeble gesture of surrender with his
bottle, one unavailing effort to raise his absinthe
to his lips, and, reeling dizzily, crashed down
upon the floor, his debauches done with forever.</p>

<p>It was a curious thing that, in the face of
this absurdity, neither of the comrades smiled.
In some unaccountable fashion Le Pochard
had come to be so much a part of their association
that in his passing there was less of
farce than tragedy. And Jean, looking across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>at Grégoire, saw for the first time the pitiful
change that had crept into the face of his
friend, the utter weariness where restless
energy had been, the dullness of the eyes
wherein had played imagination, like a will-o'-the-wisp
above the slough of destiny. And
Grégoire, looking across at Jean, knew that
the moment had come, and dropped his glance,
ashamed, fingering the tattered clothes of Le
Pochard.</p>

<p>"One might have expected it," said Jean,
with a smile that was not a smile. "I suppose
we must forgive him his faults, now that he is
gone. <em>De mortuis nil nisi bonum!</em>"</p>

<p>Then, as Grégoire made no reply, he added,</p>

<p>"I shall not work to-night. I am tired. Que
veux-tu? I have been doing too much. So we
will sit by the fire, n'est ce pas, vieux? And
thou shalt read to me as before. Dieu! It is
a long time since the moths have shown their
wings!"</p>

<p>In the tiny grate the cannel coal snapped
and spat fretfully, and Jean, buried in the
largest chair, winked at the sparks, and, furtively,
from the corners of his brown eyes,
watched Grégoire reading, half-heartedly, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>the lamp-light cutting sharply across his thin
cheek and his temples, on which the veins stood
singularly out.</p>

<p>He was no critic, little Jean le Gai, yet even
he knew that something had touched and
bruised the wings of this latest moth that Grégoire
had pursued and caught while stupid folk
were sleeping, so that it was not, as had been
the others, downed with the shifting brilliance
of many unimagined hues, but dull and sombre,
like the look he had surprised in the face
of his friend. And so subtly keyed were the
strings of their unspoken sympathy that night,
that a sense of the other's feeling stole in upon
Grégoire long before the manuscript was finished,
and suddenly he cast it from him into
the grate, where the little flames caught at it,
and wrapped it round, and sucked out its life,
exulting, until it lay blackened and dying,
writhing on the coals.</p>

<p>"Why?" said Jean. But he knew.</p>

<p>"Because," answered Grégoire slowly, with
his eyes upon the shrunken, faintly whispering
ashes of his pages, whereat the sparks gnawed
with insatiable greed, "because, my little one,
it is finished. What I have done I shall never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>do again. Never didst thou wholly understand&mdash;least
of all in these last days when thy work
absorbed thee. If one is to catch night-moths
with such a tender touch, and preserve them
for other men to see so carefully, that no one
little glint of radiance may be missing from
their wings, one has need of a clear eye and
of a steady hand. Neither is mine. My father,
of whom I have never spoken to thee,&mdash;my
father, who left me this gift of trapping the
thoughts that others see not as they fly, yet
love and prize when they are caught and pinned
upon the page, yet left me a companion curse,&mdash;the
curse of absinthe, little Jean, that is not
to be gainsaid. For as the gift was beautiful,
so was it also frail, and as the curse was subtle,
so was it also strong. I have seen the
end&mdash;long, long. Now it is here. My work
is finished. The curse has knocked at the
door of my body, and, at the signal, the gift
has flown forth from the window of my soul."</p>

<p>He paused, and pausing, smiled.</p>

<p>"Thou didst most nearly understand me,
Jean," he continued, "in buying Le Pochard.
For in truth, he was my brother&mdash;my twin&mdash;my
soul, in the semblance of a toy! How we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>have laughed at him! Yet all along I have
seen myself in that senseless little man of tin.
Is it fanciful? Peut-être bien! But, now that
he is gone, I see that I must go, too,&mdash;and in
the same way, my Jean, in the same way,&mdash;with
my absinthe in my hand and the key of inspiration
turning uselessly in the broken spring
of my heart!"</p>

<p>He rose suddenly, with a shiver, and looked
down at Jean le Gai. For an instant he
touched him on the hair, and then he was gone
into the night, leaving the little architect gazing,
wide-eyed and mute, at the crinkling ashes
of the last, unworthiest moth of all.</p>

<p>During the days that followed, Le Pochard
stood upon the mantel-corner. They no longer
touched him, but left him, as it were, a monument
to his own folly.</p>

<p>There was no further trace in Grégoire's
manner of the mood which had loosed his
tongue on the night of his last reading. To
Jean, who, in his simplicity stood ready with
comfort and encouragement, he seemed to be
in need of neither. Plainly, what he had said
was but a phase of that strange imagination
which had dictated the exquisite pathos of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>"Danaé" and his "Tristan;" and this one
thing little Jean had learned,&mdash;that his friend
lived the moods he wrote, and that oftentimes,
when what he said was seemingly most personal,
he was posing for his own pen&mdash;a
painter in speech, drawing from his reflection
in a mirror opposite. So the vague alarm
aroused by Grégoire's words died down, and
Jean plunged once more into his work.</p>

<p>In those last days of the competition his
projet, laboriously builded, detail by detail,
leaped into completion with a suddenness startling
even to himself. He knew that it was
good,&mdash;knew so without the surprising enthusiasm
of his comrades at the atelier, and the
still more surprising commendation of his patron,
the great Laloux himself, whose policy
was <em>nil admirari</em>, whose frown a habit, and
whose "Bon!" a miracle. But even Jean le
Gai, with all his buoyant optimism, was unprepared
in conviction for those words which reverberated,
to his ears like thunder, beneath
the dome of the Institut.</p>

<p>"Prix de Rome&mdash;Jean Fraissigne&mdash;Atelier
Laloux!"</p>

<p>Would Grégoire <em>never</em> come? He asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>himself the question a hundred times as he
paced the floor of their living-room an hour
before dinner, exulting in the cold roast chicken
and the champagne, and the huge Maréchale
Niel rose which he had purchased for the occasion.
For he was determined, was Jean le
Gai, that Grégoire should be the first to know.
Was it not Grégoire who had encouraged him
all along, who had prophesied success when as
yet the projet was no more than an exquisse exquisse,
who had laughed down Jean's forebodings,
and magnified Jean's hopes a hundred-fold?
Yes, evidently Grégoire must be the
first to know, before even a bleu should be sent
to Avignon to gladden the heart of Fraissigne
père!</p>

<p>But when Grégoire came, there was no need
to tell him after all. For it was the chicken
that shouted Jean's news&mdash;the chicken, and
the champagne, and the great yellow rose, and,
most of all, the face of Jean himself. So it
was that Grégoire held out his long, thin arms,
wide-spread, and that into them rushed Jean,
to be hugged and patted, as he gabbled some
things that there was such a thing as understanding
and many more that there was not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>

"Rome&mdash;Rome, think of it! And the paternel&mdash;but
he will die of joy! Ah, mon vieux,&mdash;Rome!
The dreams&mdash;the hopes&mdash;all I
have wished for&mdash;and now&mdash;and now&mdash;Ah,
mon vieux, mon vieux!"</p>

<p>And so again and again, clamoring incoherently,
while Grégoire, holding him tight, could
only pat and pat, and say, over and over,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is well, my little brother! My little brother,
it is very, very well!"</p>

<p>They dined like princes, these two, pledging
each other, laughing, singing, shouting. Never
had Jean le Gai so well deserved his name,
never had Grégoire been so whimsically droll.
Even Le Pochard was restored to his old position
and coaxed to repeat his former antics.
But it was all in vain. The key refused to
catch the spring, and, replaced upon the table,
Le Pochard only nodded once or twice with
profound melancholy, and stared at little Jean
out of his round eyes. Once, Jean thought he
caught in the face of his friend a hint of the
sadness of that other night, but when he looked
again the sadness, if sadness it were, was gone.
Grégoire filled his glass, and pledged him anew
with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>

"Rome, mon petit frère&mdash;Rome!"</p>

<p>At nine, they went out together, Jean to dispatch
his bleu and join the comrades at the
Taverne&mdash;for this was a night to be celebrated
with songs and many drained demis&mdash;and
Grégoire, who knew where?</p>

<p>Who knew where? Only the Seine, perhaps,
sulking past the rampart on which he leaned,
thinking, thinking, until the gaunt dawn crept
up, like a sick man from his bed, behind the
towers of Notre Dame; and the shutters of
the shops on the quai Conti came rattling
down, and the street cries went shrilly through
the thin morning air: "Rac'modeur d'faïence
et d'por-or-celaine!" or "'Archand de rôbinets!
Tureetutu, tureetututututu!" Then Grégoire
went slowly back to the rue de Seine.</p>

<p>Jean spent the succeeding days in a whirl
of excitement. There were calls to be made,
farewell suppers to be eaten, and all the preparation
for departure to be superintended.
Fraissigne père sent a joyful letter, and in the
letter a substantial draft, so that Jean had two
new complets, and shirts, and socks, and shoes,
and a brilliantly varnished trunk with his name
and address painted in black letters on the end,&mdash;"J.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>Fraissigne, Villa Medici, Rome." It was
magnificent! In this and a packing case he
stowed his clothes and his household gods,
though when the latter had been collected, the
little apartment in the rue de Seine looked pitifully
bare. There were dark squares on the
faded red wall-paper, and clean circles in the
dust of the shelves, where his pictures and casts
and little ornaments had been, but Grégoire
only laughed and said that the place had been
too crowded before, and that the long-needed
house-cleaning was no longer an impossibility.</p>

<p>So, before they realized the fact, the moment
of parting was upon them, and the sapin, with
Jean's luggage on top, stood waiting at the
door. The concierge, wiping her hands upon
her blue-checked apron, came out to bid her
favorite lodger good-by. A little throng of
curious idlers paused on the narrow sidewalk,
gaping at the new trunk with the glaring lettering.
The cocher was already untying the nose-bag
in which his lean brown horse had been
nuzzling for fifteen minutes. And, on the curb,
arm linked in arm, the two comrades stood
watching him, with no courage to meet each
other's eyes. For each had a thousand things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>to say and never a word in which to say so
much as one.</p>

<p>At the end, as their hands met, it was only
a commonplace that came to Jean's tongue.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt write me, vieux? And in four
years&mdash;ce qui va vite, du reste!&mdash;we shall be
together once more!"</p>

<p>In four years&mdash;in four years&mdash;in four years!
The words beat dully at Grégoire's temples, as
he watched the cab swing round the corner
of the Institut toward the quai Malaquais, with
Jean's handkerchief fluttering at the window of
the portière. Four years&mdash;four years&mdash;four
years! How easy it was to say for one who
did not know that the end had come,&mdash;that
the moths of fancy that fly by night must be
caught by others now, that the siren of absinthe
was standing ready to claim her own!</p>

<p>Grégoire mounted the stairs slowly, unlocked
the door, and stepped into the familiar room,
dim now in the last faint light of day. His
absinthe stood upon the table, and he took it
up, and paused, looking about him. Presently
he went forward to the mantel, and, laying one
hand upon it, bent forward, peering at a little
photograph of Jean which leaned against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>mirror. The woodwork jarred under his touch,
and Le Pochard in his corner stirred, ticked
feebly, and strove to raise his cup to his lips.
Wheeling at the sound, Grégoire met the eyes
of the dissipated little toy for a full minute,
motionless and silent. Then with a sob, he
hurled his glass into the grate, where it was
shivered into a hundred fragments, and flung
himself on his knees by the divan, with his face
buried in his hands.</p>

<p>"Mon frèrot!" he murmured, "my little
brother&mdash;help me&mdash;help me to be strong."</p>

<p>On the mantle, Le Pochard bent his head
and gazed shamefacedly upon the ground.</p>

<p>For his reign was at an end.</p>

<p class="dropcap">THE distance between them is far less
than is commonly supposed. In fact,
they are separated only by a parti-wall.
But there is a vast difference in their exteriors,
Heaven being gay with silver paint and stucco
cherubs, and illuminated by a huge arc-light
with a white globe, and Hell all red, with a
monster's grinning mouth for entrance, and
a ruby lamp.</p>

<p>The two cabarets stand on the boulevard de
Clichy, side by side, and, when one is passing
through Paris on a Cook ticket, good for a two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>weeks' stay, one is taken by an obliging friend
of the Colony to see them, and so is enabled
to return to the States with the pleasing conviction
of having had a glimpse of the true life
of Montmartre,&mdash;the which is so artistic, and
Bohemian, and all that.</p>

<p>It is something, as every one knows, to be
an angel in Le Ciel; but it is also something,
as every one does <em>not</em> know, to be a demon
in L'Enfer. Aside from the sentiment of the
thing, it is all the same,&mdash;harps and halos or
horns and hoofs. The clientèle of both places
is, for the most part, étrangère, and what is certain
is that an American never counts the little
money one gives him in change, and that an
Englishman disputes it anyway, so that, in the
beginning, one might as well be wrong as right,
and that a German is unable to tell a louis from
a new sou. And a pourboire is a pourboire,
whether intentional or otherwise. That is why
Maxime Perrot felt himself to be a remarkably
fortunate person when, one evening in June,
he was suddenly transformed into an angel, as
a result of his intimacy with Gustave Robine.</p>

<p>Gustave was two metres twelve in height,
which is something so astonishing in itself that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>it is not to be wondered at that, for more than
a year, he had filled the eminent position of
guardian of the gate of Le Ciel, and was much
in favor with the management, because of the
attention he attracted from the clients. Also,
he kept his eyes open, and, moreover, he owed
Maxime fifty francs. So, when one of the
angels abruptly married a rich widow, and
departed for Maisons-Laffitte, to live on her
ample rentes, Gustave mentioned the name of
his friend and creditor for the vacancy, and,
the next day, Maxime became one of the personnel
of Heaven, with a fresh pair of wings
and new pink fleshings.</p>

<p>Maxime was short and slender, in all except
his feet, which were long and large, so long
and large, indeed, that he was called l'L Majuscule&mdash;the
Capital L&mdash;by his intimates,
and fully merited the nickname when viewed
in profile, standing. His experiences in life
had been diverse, for, as he himself was wont
to say, he cared less for an existence without
variety than does a fish for an apple. He had
driven a voiture de remise, gorgeous in a green
cockade and doeskin breeches: he had been
collector for the Banque de France, dismissed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>let charity say not why: and garçon de restaurant,
racing to and fro, with a mammoth tray
balanced on one upright arm, like a human
umbrella: and camelot, hoarsely crying "La
Patrie!" in front of the boulevard cafés: and,
finally, valet de chambre to Captain the Honorable
Michael Douglas, military attaché to the
British Embassy. It was in the last capacity
that he had learned English, which now he
spoke, said Gustave, like a veritable Goddem.
That was not the least of the new angel's qualifications.
To be sure, it was against all reason
that the sales anglais should, under any circumstances,
achieve an entrée into Heaven, but then
there were many incongruities in connection
with Le Ciel, and the fact remained that three
out of five of the clients spoke Angliche, and
an angel who could reply to them in their own
ignoble argot was, without doubt, an invaluable
acquisition.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that Maxime made a
good beginning in Heaven. He entered upon
his new duties modestly, and spent a full half-hour
of the early evening cleaning the long
table in the main hall, dusting the surrounding
stools of gold, upon which the chosen were to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>sit, and assisting his fellow angels in polishing
the liqueur glasses. And it so happened that
the first to enter that night was Major Amos
E. Cogswell, of the United States Army, who
had spent three weeks in Paris at the age of
twenty-two, and distinguished himself by demanding,
on his second arrival, the way to the
Jardin Mabille. With the Major were his two
nieces, and their attendant swains, John Selfridge
Appleby and P. Hamilton Beck, the
latter in narrow-brimmed straw hats, which
resembled lids of Japanese tea-pots, and dogskin
walking gloves, turned back at the wrists.
The party entered with an air of bravado, and
were heard to remark that this was <span class="smcap">IT</span>,&mdash;whatever
that might mean. It was Maxime's opportunity,
and he improved it to the utmost, seating
the newcomers around the head of the table,
and demanding, "Ces messieurs désirent?" as
if completely oblivious to the fact that they
were anything but bred-in-the-bone boulevardiers.
For there was need of precaution. It
is an inexplicable thing about these English
that one is charmed to be addressed in his
own tongue, and the next is insulted. It pays
to feel one's way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>"What does he say?" said Major Cogswell,
turning, helplessly, to P. Hamilton Beck, who
had taken French II. at Columbia.</p>

<p>"Wants us to name the drinks," responded
that accomplished young gentleman.</p>

<p>"Spik Ingliss?" put in l'L Majuscule, deploying
the skirmishers of his vocabulary.</p>

<p>"Tchure!" said Mr. Beck.</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied Maxime, much gratified,
"zen v'at eest? V'at veel de zaintlemans
aff?"</p>

<p>"Cream de mint," said the Major, promptly,
and, his companions agreeing with alacrity,
Mr. Beck again undertook the rôle of interpreter.</p>

<p>"Sank cream de mint," he commanded, holding
up his left hand, wide-spread, "et toute
suite."</p>

<p>And, in a surprisingly brief space of time,
five infinitesimal glasses of the green liqueur
stood before them.</p>

<p>"Mais avec du glace," remonstrated Mr.
Beck.</p>

<p>"What's that; what's that?" inquired the
Major anxiously, as the glasses were as suddenly
removed by the abashed Maxime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>

"Oh, ice, that's all," replied the other.
"These chaps don't know what's what. Leave
'em to me. One has to know how to handle
'em."</p>

<p>Following the entrance of the Americans,
the cabaret had gradually filled. The majority
of the places at the long table were occupied
now by a curious assemblage of sensation-seekers,&mdash;Germans
in little cloth hats of dark
green, with a curled feather cropping up behind,
Englishmen in tweeds and traveling-caps,
with visors fore and aft, American architects
from the Quartier, so well disguised by
slouch felts, pointed beards, and baggy trousers,
that only a nasal tang in their slangy
French betrayed their nationality, and a sprinkling
of Frenchmen, each clasping the hand of
a grisette. Already the high-priest of Le Ciel
was in his gilded pulpit, delivering an oration
thickly sown with "mes s&oelig;urs" and "mes
frères" and "chers bénis," at which strangers
and Parisians alike laughed uproariously, and
all for one good reason&mdash;because the Frenchmen
understood! Maxime returned, bringing
the five liqueurs in larger glasses with chopped
ice. The head angel made the round of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>table, carrying, on a pole, the gilded image of
a pig, and a pseudo-sexton stood leaning on
the rail of a celestial stairway leading to the
second floor, sprinkling the assemblage with
so-called holy water from a colored brush. It
was all very French, very conventional,&mdash;or
unconventional, according to the point of view
of the spectator,&mdash;very sacrilegious from any
point of view.</p>

<p>With that curious instinct of womanhood
which seems to recognize the indelicate, even
in unfamiliar surroundings, even in an unknown
tongue, the younger Miss Cogswell
leaned forward suddenly and touched the Major
on the hand.</p>

<p>"Let us go," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes!" agreed Appleby, buttoning his coat,
"let's be moving. What do you say? Let's
go to Hell&mdash;I mean," he added, with a blush,
"let's try the other cabaret."</p>

<p>The Major agreed with a sigh of relief. He
had understood nothing of the mummery going
on about him, but he was possessed by the conviction
that in some way his party was the butt
of the occasion, and had kept looking around
abruptly, in hope of catching the angels giggling
behind his back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>

"Will you ask the waiter how much I owe?"
He appealed to Beck.</p>

<p><em>How much!</em></p>

<p>Maxime picked these two essential words
out of the rapid phrase like a squirrel snapping
a peanut from its shell. He had not
been garçon at the Café Américain for nothing,
Maxime. His countenance assumed an expression
of beatific innocence as he looked
over the Major's head, at the high-priest in the
gilded pulpit.</p>

<p>"Tain francs," he observed, mildly.</p>

<p>This was a tide in the affairs of P. Hamilton
Beck which, plainly, must be taken at the
flood. The elder Miss Cogswell was looking
at him expectantly, and Heaven had, of a sudden,
grown very still. He leaped into the
breach with all the eloquence accumulated
during eight months of French II.</p>

<p>"Mon foi, non! cream de mint coute seulement
un franc la verre dans les établissements
plus chers. Il ne faut pas nous voler, parceque
nous sont étrangères!"</p>

<p>"What's that; what's that?" said the Major.</p>

<p>"He's trying to rob us," explained Beck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>much excited. "Says it's ten francs. It can't
possibly be more than five, and it <em>ought</em> to be
two francs fifty."</p>

<p>The Major immediately became purple with
indignation.</p>

<p>"But, God bless my soul!" he exclaimed,
"the rascal understands English as well as
any one of us. What's the use of wasting
your French on him?"</p>

<p>He swung round upon his stool, and fixed
an eye, which was celebrated in the 32d Regular
Infantry, upon l'L Majuscule. That worthy
surveyed with unfeigned astonishment this very
angry, red-faced foreigner, who looked as if he
was about to devour him, body and bones. He
had not the most remote conception of the effect
which his flaxen wig, and his ridiculous
wings, and his short pleated tunic, and his
pink tights, and his huge feet in their gilded
sandals, produced upon the Major; and his attempt
at extortion was strictly in line with the
traditions of the place. Certainly, it was all
very puzzling.</p>

<p>"You ape!" said the Major furiously, finding
his breath. "You pinky-panky little scoundrel!
<em>You</em> an angel? Why you're not even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>shaved! You get two francs fifty, that's what
you get, and not a red cent of porbwure either,
you Christmas-tree image!"</p>

<p>The exact phrasing of these remarks was
somewhat lost upon Maxime, but the general
trend of the Major's meaning was quite unmistakable.
Nevertheless, when one had been
valet de chambre to Captain the Honorable Michael
Douglas, one was not routed by a few emphatic
words. So Maxime shrugged his shoulders
apologetically, and reiterated his "Tain
francs."</p>

<p>"Damn it, sir, <em>no</em>!" thundered the Major.
"And don't pretend you can't understand me.
I'm a short-tempered man, sir, and&mdash;and"&mdash;</p>

<p>He pounded with his fist upon the table,
seeking a fitting expression of his rage, until
the little liqueur glasses danced like kernels
of popping corn. But young Appleby leaned
toward him and laid a hand on his arm. He
was big and square-shouldered, was Appleby,
and, only the year before, he had performed
prodigies with the hammer and the shot in the
Intercollegiate Games; but his eyes were very
blue and gentle, and he spoke with extreme
mildness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
"Don't let us have any trouble here, sir,"
he said. "It isn't as if we were alone. We
have the girls with us, you know. Leave the
beggar two francs fifty, and we'll go on to the
next place."</p>

<p>Now the Major, with all his fiery temper,
was an ardent lover of discipline, and he recognized
reason in Appleby's words. So, after
an instant, he deposited the amount upon the
table, rose to his full height, with his eye still
riveted on Maxime, and then, followed by the
others, stalked majestically toward the door.</p>

<p>But for one circumstance, the Americans
had never gone unmolested past Maxime's fellow-angels,
and, in particular, the towering form
of Gustave Robine. Maxime himself was astounded
that no celestial hand was stretched
out to bar their progress. What he did not
understand was that, while one may enter Le
Ciel on the strength of an accomplishment not
possessed by the other immortals, the achievement
does not necessarily imply that one is
<em>persona grata</em> in their eyes, or, in the least degree,
sure of their support. The management
was responsible for Maxime, and the edict had
gone forth that the Angliches were to be turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>over to him. But obedience to this command
did not go hand in hand with approval thereof.
The high-priest and the sexton and all the
angels had looked on sourly, as he appropriated
the Major's party, for it is the Americans
who give the largest pourboires; and, although
they did not wholly comprehend the dispute
which had arisen, it was evident that the linguistic
angel had met with disaster at the very
outset, and they were proportionately gratified.
So, when Maxime glanced about in search
of succor, he found himself abandoned in his
discomfiture. The other angels were smiling
broadly, and nudging each other with their
pink elbows; the high-priest, with his fat hands
on the pulpit's edge, was looking down at him
with a grin; the sexton above his head waved
his brush to and fro and chanted, "<em>Ora pro
nobis!</em>" in a high, whining voice. A French
student at the further end of the table said
"Roulé!" and his companion laughed shrilly.
Even Gustave, at the door, was leaning on his
halberd and chuckling, for he had not forgotten
that Maxime, once sure of his position,
had demanded repayment of the fifty francs.</p>

<p>All this was sufficiently intolerable, but a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>real disaster, more terrible than mere ridicule,
confronted Maxime. The crême de menthe
was, as a matter of fact, one franc a glass, and
it was out of his pocket that the deficit would
have to be made good. As this tragic thought
smote him full and fair, he bounded forward
past the other angels, dodged nimbly under
Gustave's outstretched arm, charged through
the swinging doors, and emerged with a shout
upon the boulevard de Clichy.</p>

<p>The Major's party had paused before the
entrance of L'Enfer, while Beck parleyed with
the courteous demon in scarlet tights who kept
the door, and the others stood by, sublimely
unconscious of the none too complimentary
comments of a half score of cochers and boulevard
loungers who surrounded them. Into the
midst of this assemblage swooped l'L Majuscule,
his flaxen wig awry, his wings bobbing
wildly on his shoulders, and his white tunic
fluttering in the wind. Blind to consequences,
he darted upon the unsuspecting Major, and
seized him furiously by the coat.</p>

<p>"Eh! vieille saucisse!" he exclaimed. "Tu
te fiches de moi&mdash;quoi?"</p>

<p>Now John Appleby had never enjoyed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>advantages of French II., which shed such
effulgence upon his classmate, but he knew
the answer to this question, none the less. It
had been taught him in the boxing-room of his
athletic club, and it was surprisingly conclusive
when applied to the under jaw of an infuriated
angel. The ruby and white arc-lights before
the cabarets suddenly joined in a mad waltz,
the cabarets themselves turned upside down,
the cochers and loungers swooped into the air
like pigeons, a passing tram leaped into the
trees on the further side of the driveway and
disappeared, and, from somewhere, a factory
whistle came close up to Maxime's side and
said, "<em>Oo-oo-ooo-oooo!</em>" in his ear.</p>

<p>He came to himself slowly. There was an
acrid taste in his mouth, and this, upon investigation,
proved to be boulevard mud. There
was something fuzzy gripped tightly in his right
hand, and this presently resolved itself into his
wings. Then he saw his feet, which were elevated
above the level of his head, by reason of
being on the curb, while the rest of his person
was in the gutter. Then the mammoth red
face of a cocher bulged out of the night, close
to his own, and a voice said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you harm, angel?"</p>

<p>Then he remembered, sat up, and looked
around.</p>

<p>On the boulevard de Clichy, spectators
grow out of the ground, spontaneously, when
there is an excuse for their presence. A hundred
or more now surrounded Maxime, with
open mouths, and staring eyes that slid to and
fro from his prostrate form to the faces of an
agent and a vehement gentleman in a frock
coat and a flat-brimmed huit reflets, who were
disputing violently. In the crowd were all the
other angels, and the better part of those who
had been seated at the table of Heaven. The
sexton, brush in hand, was gaping over the
agent's shoulder, the high-priest was explaining
the affair, with much elaboration, to all who
would listen to him, and above the rest towered
the face of Gustave Robine, still smiling
blandly. The only unconcerned figure in sight
was that of a courteous demon in scarlet tights,
who was staring up at the sky from the doorway
of L'Enfer. For Beck had slipped a gold
piece into his hand,&mdash;as the Major and his
party hurried inside, dragging the protesting
Appleby by the arm,&mdash;and he knew how to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>keep his counsel. After all, the sanctity of hospitality
must be respected, even in Hell.</p>

<p>"But no, I tell you, but no!" exclaimed the
gentleman of the huit reflets, who was none
other than the manager of Heaven.</p>

<p>"It is equal to me! It is equal to me!"
stormed the agent. "I saw it, do you hear?
He was struck, and the law does not allow&mdash;They
went in there"&mdash;</p>

<p>He made a motion, as if to thrust the other
aside and plunge toward the entrance of L'Enfer.
But the manager of Heaven was not to
be thus outdone. He was determined that the
incident should be considered closed; and for
this there were reasons. It was but the beginning
of the tourist season, and the foreign clientèle
must not be antagonized. A paragraph
in the "Matin," a sensational article in the
"Herald" of to-morrow, and the Angliches
would believe that the Cabaret du Ciel was no
safe place for foreigners to enter. In agonized
imagination he saw the gate receipts of Heaven
dwindling, disappearing. It were better,
far better, to sacrifice Maxime. He grasped
the agent by the arm, and pointed to the fallen
angel, who was still seated in the gutter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>collecting his scattered wits, with a vacant
stare.</p>

<p>"Look you," he said, persuasively, "this
tripe, this species of onion, this example of an
eel, is the cause of all. It is I who know, n'est
ce pas? being his patron. Eh b'en, I assure
you that it is a drunkard of the most abandoned.
Thirteen times in the dozen, one finds
him in the fog, rigid as the Obelisk, bon Dieu!
not merely lit, voyons, but flaming,&mdash;as full as
Robespierre's donkey,&mdash;asphyxiated! It is
not a man, sac à papier! It is a sponge&mdash;but
a sponge, do you understand?&mdash;a pompier!
He dries glasses&mdash;<em>poof!</em>&mdash;like that! Il lave
sa gueule là-dedans, nothing less!"</p>

<p>"Bravo!" said Gustave Robine, and all the
angels applauded. The agent paused, doubtful
of what course to pursue, overwhelmed by
this burst of eloquence, and Top-Hat, perceiving
the impression he had made, addressed
himself to Maxime.</p>

<p>"Waffle!" he cried, contemptuously.
"Cream of a tart! Thou wast there, then, the
day of the distribution, O stupid as thy feet!
And who art thou, let us hear, to find thyself
in a position to apply kicks to the clients? If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>thou wert employed at La Villette, where they
slaughter pigs, sacred stove, thy first blow
would be suicide!"</p>

<p>He rose, in a majestic sweep, to the pinnacle
of supreme courtesy.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le marquis has, perhaps, hurt
himself, stumbling by accident? Is it permitted
to the obedient servitor of monsieur le
marquis to inquire if monsieur le marquis has
sustained any damage by reason of his deplorable
mischance?"</p>

<p>He descended, in a graceful curve, to the
depths of utter scorn.</p>

<p>"Animal low of ceiling! Camel! Gourd!
Ancient senator! Gas-jet! Shut thy mouth,
or I jump within!"</p>

<p>And he paused,&mdash;breathless, but triumphant.</p>

<p>It was magnificent! In the annals of Heaven
there was record of no such climax of vituperation.
The angels surveyed their patron with
undisguised admiration. Even the agent
touched the visor of his cap.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," he said, "I yield the field to
you. Your vocabulary is unrivaled&mdash;unless
by General Cambronne!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>

"Monsieur, you flatter me," replied the other,
with a bow.</p>

<p>Some one had helped l'L Majuscule to his
feet, and he stood there, a preposterous figure,
in soiled pink tights, holding out his wings,
with his huge feet turned in like a pigeon's.</p>

<p>"Monsieur le directeur"&mdash;he began.</p>

<p>"He speaks!" cried Huit Reflets, whirling
around and addressing the throng. "He <em>dares</em>
to speak, this bad sou, this oyster! He does
not comprehend that he is discharged. He
counts that I am about to resign in his favor!
Ah, non, it is too much!"</p>

<p>He flung himself about again, facing Maxime.</p>

<p>"Well, then," he added with forced calm,
"thou art put at the door, is it clear? Take
thy rags from yonder, and begone!"</p>

<p>"Mais, monsieur"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the director, flinging his arms
upward; and immediately vanished within the
silver gates of Heaven, followed by his personnel,
with the fallen angel bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, having exchanged his
celestial raiment for his former earthly garb,
Monsieur Perrot sat in solitary state at a table
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>in the café Cyrano, and pondered the details
of a project of revenge. The idea had come
to him suddenly, like an inspiration, on seeing
the nonchalant demon at the portals of
L'Enfer, but it required arranging, elaboration.
A man who made one blunder was but human,
but a man who made two in succession&mdash;that
was a mere root of celery! So l'L Majuscule
thought hard. And when the will is so earnest,
it is strange if the way be not forthcoming.
At midnight he arose with a sigh of satisfaction,
and took his way homeward, smiling.</p>

<p>It was barely eight o'clock, the following
evening, when Maxime entered L'Enfer. He
was tastefully dressed in an excessively checked
suit and a silk hat, and he wore a full black
beard and spectacles, and rolled his r's in
speaking, in the fashion of the South. The
demon at the door, unsuspecting, greeted him
effusively as "cher damné," and piloted him to
a table at the further end of the cabaret. The
table had a ground-glass top, through which
shone electric lights which kept changing mysteriously
from green to red and back again, and
the whole interior of L'Enfer was of imitation
rock, diversified by grinning faces. It was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>artistic, and, what was better, very dark. Maxime
was unnecessarily mistrustful of his false
beard.</p>

<p>At this early hour, he was the only visitor.
An obliging demon supplied him with a green
chartreuse, and, upon invitation, procured another
for himself, and took the opposite seat.</p>

<p>The conversation, which began with commonplaces,
soon assumed a more intimate tone.
Monsieur, it appeared, was from Toulouse, but
this was not his first visit to L'Enfer. In fact,
a place so amusing&mdash;what? He never missed
it when he came to Paris.</p>

<p>Oh, but monsieur was too good!</p>

<p>No, on the contrary, it was for his own pleasure.
It suited him to a marvel, blague à part!
And often, he had had a curious fancy&mdash;to be
a demon himself, imagine! To serve in the
cabaret for just one evening, by way of variety&mdash;for,
as for himself, he gave less for a life
without variety than did a fish for an apple.
That was the reason he had sometimes thought
of applying to the management for permission
to&mdash;but then, of course, the idea was fantastic,
and, without doubt, quite impossible.</p>

<p>Oh, quite impossible, monsieur!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>But, after all, why not? Not the management,
naturally. That was out of the question,
it went without saying. But an obliging
demon, perhaps&mdash;a bon type, who understood
these eccentricities, as a man of the world&mdash;one
who would consent to a brief illness&mdash;for
one night only&mdash;and who would provide a
substitute, <em>in the person of monsieur</em>! Fantastic&mdash;what?&mdash;rigolo,
mon Dieu!&mdash;very rigolo,
and, of course, quite impossible.</p>

<p>In some mysterious fashion a louis suddenly
made its appearance on the illuminated table.</p>

<p>Oh, quite impossible, monsieur! Evidently,
affairs did not arrange themselves like that.
Monsieur must understand that the pourboires
which one gained in Hell were enormous&mdash;but
<em>enormous</em>! It would be to throw away a fortune,
to give up one's place for an entire evening.
For forty francs, perhaps&mdash;but then it
was certain that monsieur would not care&mdash;</p>

<p>There was a tiny click upon the table-top,
and the one louis had become two. A most
surprising place, L'Enfer!</p>

<p>Ah! But in addition, there were details to
be arranged, and one could not talk with frankness
in the cabaret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>

The doors at the further end swung open,
and the demon of the gate made his appearance,
ushering in a group of tourists. Maxime
substituted two francs for the two louis,
and rose.</p>

<p>"That for the liqueurs, my friend," he said,
"and what you say is true. The café Cyrano
is a better place for talking. At midnight."</p>

<p>Fifty-seven francs. The project had cost
him fifty-seven francs, said the fallen angel to
himself, as, twenty-four hours later, he dusted
an illuminated table. What with his beard, and
his spectacles, and two chartreuses in L'Enfer,
and six demis at the café Cyrano&mdash;for the conference
had been long&mdash;and, finally, the bribe
to the obliging demon, revenge had cost him
fifty-seven francs and it was not yet complete!
But the prospects therefor were fair. He
chuckled silently, with his eyes on the parti-wall
which divided Hell from Heaven. It was
eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a stir in the cabaret. A
voice was calling, "This way, chers damnés, to
the Hall of the Infernal Visions!" and the
clients were rising from their tables, and crowding
out like sheep through a narrow door to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>the right. Almost immediately the place was
empty, save for the fallen angel and two other
demons, clearing away the liqueur glasses, and
setting the stools in place. It was the dreamt-of
moment. Maxime walked carelessly toward
the door.</p>

<p>In Le Ciel, the long table was full from end
to end. The high-priest in his pulpit was delivering
his accustomed discourse with extreme
satisfaction, and the head angel making the
round of the room, bearing the golden pig upon
the pole. The angels, each in his place, abode
the moment of the clients' exodus into the Hall
of the Celestial Visions, which was coincident
with the semi-hourly harvest of pourboires. In
particular, their eyes were fixed upon a party
of American tourists, under direction of a uniformed
guide. These were worthy of comment,
and received it. It appeared that the
thin lady with the loose cloth costume was
an empty bed ticking. There were other remarks,
but this, from Gustave Robine, was the
most successful. However, there were the
pourboires to be considered, so the angels spoke
in whispers.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, the calm of Heaven was broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>by an appalling sound, something midway between
a shriek and a bark, and on the end of
the table nearest the door appeared a terrible
form, black-bearded and all in scarlet, with two
long feathers nodding from his cap, and a polished
two-pronged pitchfork brandished in one
upraised hand. An instant he paused, superbly
statuesque, his eyes blazing, an incarnation of
demoniac fury. And, as if the sensation produced
by his dramatic entrance were not sufficient,
the newcomer received unexpected support
from the thin lady in loose cloth costume,
who, upon his appearance, promptly exclaimed
"Good land!" and fell backward off her stool
upon the floor.</p>

<p>Then Bedlam broke loose. The doorway of
Le Ciel is less than a metre in width, and when
a score of affrighted tourists, and seven angels,
and six French students with their grisettes,
and a high-priest, and two corpulent Germans,
and a sexton, and Gustave Robine are suddenly
and simultaneously imbued with a desire
to sample the air of the boulevard de Clichy,
confusion is apt to result. There were shrieks
and groans, protestations, oaths in three languages,
a wild chaos of legs and arms, wings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>white tunics, traveling caps, tweed suits, and
golden stools, and over all pranced the crimson
form of the invader, whirling up and down
the table with unearthly cries, and kicking the
liqueur glasses and little saucers in every direction.
They were all agreed, both mortals
and celestials, in believing him a madman, and
agreed, also, in thinking the pavement of the
boulevard a thing greatly to be desired. The
demon paused presently, and watched them
struggling in a frenzied mass about the door,
and then he vanished as abruptly as he had
appeared.</p>

<p>For l'L Majuscule had not wasted the early
hours of the evening in L'Enfer, and he knew
now that the rear entrances of Heaven and
Hell gave upon a common court, full of barrels,
and empty bottles, and discarded properties,
and even as the panic he had created was at its
height, he had made the circuit, and was bustling
into his original disguise.</p>

<p>The doorkeeper of L'Enfer, on the outlook
for clients, had stared in stupefaction as Maxime,
in his demon's garb, darted past him and
plunged into the entrance of Le Ciel, and when,
a moment later, his ears were startled by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>pandemonium inside the rival cabaret, he had
first, with commendable presence of mind,
shouted "Au feu! A l'assassin! Au secours!"
to his fellows in L'Enfer, and then repeated
the cry at the top of his lungs on the curb of
the boulevard. So it was that the clients and
personnel of Heaven and Hell reached the sidewalk
almost simultaneously. Gustave, halberd
in hand, came full upon a demon barring his
path, and, mistaking him for the original intruder,
fell upon him furiously. Other demons
came to their companion's aid, other angels to
Gustave's, and immediately fourscore individuals
were battling desperately, without knowing
or caring why. Agents appeared as if by
magic, screaming for reinforcement, and pulling
fainting women out of the mêlée by their
heads and heels. Spectators ran up by hundreds,
and formed a rampart around the fray.
And, to add chaos to confusion, a detachment
of sapeurs-pompiers presently drove up in a red
wagon, their horn hee-hawing like an impatient
donkey. Last of all, a thin gentleman with
preposterously large feet, black-bearded, spectacled,
and wearing an excessively checked
suit, came calmly out of L'Enfer, shouldered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>his way to a position of vantage in the throng,
and stood, smiling down upon the havoc.</p>

<p>Peace was restored. But a half dozen of
the combatants were already in the hands of
the police, and were hurried away to the poste,
protesting volubly. Among these were Gustave
Robine, in a pitiful state of demoralization,
and the doorkeeper of L'Enfer, and the
director of Le Ciel, with his huits reflets, crushed
to an unrecognizable mass, clutched desperately
in his hand.</p>

<p>Then every second person in the crowd explained
to his neighbor how it all occurred,
and, among others, a stalwart workingman proceeded
to enlighten the spectacled gentleman
at his side.</p>

<p>"It appears there was a madman," he said.
"Bon sang! What places, these cabarets&mdash;what
infected boxes, name of a dog!"</p>

<p>"Ah, ça!" replied the other, rolling his r's
in speaking, in the fashion of the South, and
leering at the back of the struggling director.
"But then such an affair is in the chapter of
variety, and as for me, I care less for a life
without variety than does a fish for an apple!"</p>

<h2><a id="Poire"></a>Poire!</h2>

<p class="dropcap">LIEUTENANT EUGENE DROUIN
slid from his saddle with a little grunt,
slipped his arm through the bridle-rein,
and then, with his riding crop, rapped smartly
on the round, tin-topped table nearest to him.
At the summons, a small square door on the
left of the archway snapped open, and a
stumpy waiter, shaped like a domino, appeared
abruptly on the sill.</p>

<p>"Froid!" shouted the officer.</p>

<p>The domino waiter made a vague gesture in
the air with one fat hand, and then vanished
as suddenly as he had appeared, closing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>door behind him with a slam. If he had but
seen fit to observe "Cuckoo!" the whole affair&mdash;the
sort of châlet from which he emerged,
the small square door, and his own performance&mdash;would
have borne a remarkable resemblance
to a Swiss clock striking one.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Drouin detached an end of the
rein from the snaffle-bar, knotted it about the
back of one chair and flung himself into another.</p>

<p>"Poof!" he said, and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>It was exactly one o'clock, and the Pré Catalan
was deserted, save for a half dozen cats
of various breeds and colors, chasing each
other about under the chairs and tables, and
two brilliant macaws sitting on wooden perches
in an apparent state of coma, broken only by
an occasional reflective "Wawk!" Once, a
high cart flashed in an opening of the trees to
the left, and then disappeared with a rattle of
harness chains, in the direction of the porte
Dauphine. For the rest, there was nothing to
suggest that Paris might not be fifty kilometres
distant. All the world was at breakfast.</p>

<p>Eugène stretched his legs, squinted at the
toes of his narrow riding boots, and swore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>tenderly at himself for having refused the invitation
of the Marquise de Baucheron. Experience
might have taught him that Rosa de
Mirecourt would not be in the Bois that morning.
It was a peculiarity of Rosa's to be in evidence
on every occasion when her presence was
not to be desired, and never to turn up when one
was in the mood to chat or breakfast with her.
Eugène had measured the Acacias bridle-path
at a canter eight times since noon, scanning
the driveway for a glimpse of the blue and
scarlet victoria with the cream-colored mares,
and all in vain. Rosa was nowhere to be seen.
By this time, no doubt, some other lieutenant
of chasseurs was thrashing out the latest gossip
of the demi-monde over her breakfast table
in the rue de Bassano, and still another was,
in all probability, filling his place at Madame
de Baucheron's, and eating the Friday breakfast&mdash;sole
cardinale and &oelig;ufs brouillés aux
crevettes&mdash;for which her chef was famous.
Baste! what a world!</p>

<p>The domino waiter reappeared presently in
the doorway, came quickly across to Eugène's
table with a curious, tottering shuffle born of his
swaddling apron, and served a small white mug
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>of cold milk as if it had been Château Latour-Blanche.</p>

<p>"Beautiful weather, my lieutenant," he ventured
cheerfully, for he had done his service,
and knew the meaning of the single epaulette.</p>

<p>But Eugène was in no mood for light conversation.
For sole reply, he paid his score,
and then drank the milk slowly, looking out
toward the lower lake, across the wide stretch
of fresh grass mottled with flecks of sunlight
sifted through the foliage above. At his side
Vivandière nuzzled the turf along the border
of the graveled terrasse, the lithe muscles rippling
in her polished neck, and her deep eye
shifting now and again in its socket as she
looked doubtfully, almost pleadingly, toward
her master. They were well known on the Allée
and the bridle-path of the avenue du Bois,
these two,&mdash;the young chasseur, tall, clean-cut,
and slender, with a complexion like a girl's,
and the gayety of Polichinelle himself, in full
red breeches and tunic of black and light blue;
and the chestnut mare, nervous and alert, with
her racing lines, and her long, leisurely gallop,
superb in its suggestion of reserve speed and
unflagging endurance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>The fates were kind to Lieutenant Eugène
Drouin. Paris, spring, youth, an ample fortune,
a commission in the <em>chasseurs</em>, good
looks, a thoroughbred Arab, and a half dozen
women frankly in love with him,&mdash;surely there
was nothing lacking; and yet he knew that
something was lacking, though he could not
have said what, as he sat sprawling in his little
iron chair at the Pré Catalan that morning.</p>

<p>He straightened himself suddenly, as she
came up the driveway from the left, and then
rose with a stiff salute, for, a pace or so behind,
walked Vieux César, so-called by an irreverent
garrison, leading two horses, one limping badly.
Eugène had seen him but once, at the review
of the Quatorze Juillet, but, though he was
not in uniform now, the fierce gray mustache
and keen black eyes of General Tournadour
were too familiar to Parisians to pass unrecognized
in a throng, much less under circumstances
such as these. When one has been
Military Governor of Paris, and held the portfolio
of war, one does not achieve <em>incognito</em>
merely by donning a black civile. So Eugène
saluted the general&mdash;but with his eyes on the
girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>She was not beautiful, he told himself, in
that first moment of surprise and swift observation,
but about her, as she barely glanced at
him in passing, there was an indefinably compellant
charm which arrested his attention and
held it, like an unrecognized but strangely
sweet perfume, suddenly met with in a familiar
spot where there is no apparent reason for its
presence. Without doubt, it was a very little
thing. He knew enough of such matters to be
aware that an unanalyzed attraction of the kind
which, at first glance, makes a woman appear
utterly irresistible, is apt, on closer acquaintance,
to resolve itself into the merest trifle of
dissimilarity from other women,&mdash;a tilt of a
lip-corner, a dimple in an unlikely spot, a trick
with the hands or the head, a rebellious wisp of
hair. For he was very philosophical, and very
wise, was Eugène, and twenty-six years of age,
into the bargain. So there was nothing one
could tell him about women. But, in any
event, there was no time to define the particular
charm in question. He felt rather than
saw it, as she went by him, with the faintest
possible whiff of orris, and the gleam of a
patent-leather boot at the edge of her habit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>No, she was certainly not beautiful, but she
was something dangerously, deliciously akin,
said Lieutenant Drouin to himself; and that,
in the unloveliest costume that can be worn by
womankind,&mdash;a deep-green habit of extreme
severity, and a squat derby, like a boy's, with
an elastic strap brutally grooving her ruddy
hair.</p>

<p>General Tournadour did not follow the girl
beyond the spot where Eugène was standing,
but drew up abruptly, and indicated the lamed
horse with a gesture of irritation.</p>

<p>"A beautiful affair, my word, lieutenant!"
he said. "This animal stumbled, back there,
and has received some injury,&mdash;I know not
what. We have walked from the Allée, in
hope of finding a sapin here, and all without
result."</p>

<p>The young officer was already feeling the
animal's hocks with a practiced hand. There
was a swelling just above the right fore fetlock,
and as he touched it, the horse winced
and kicked out sharply.</p>

<p>"A bad wrench, I fear, my general," said
Eugène. "He should have an hour's rest, at
least." Then, looking quickly at the saddle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>"It is evident that madame cannot ride him
home. No doubt they will give him a stall in
the farm stable. You can send a groom out
for him this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Dieu! That is very well, monsieur," answered
the former minister of war, with an air
of perplexity amusingly in contrast with his
fierce moustache. "But my daughter"&mdash;</p>

<p>Now Lieutenant Drouin, in matters where
a woman was concerned, was nothing if not
adroit. He sent a flying glance in the direction
of the girl. She had aroused one of the
comatose macaws from his lethargy, and now
stood watching him as he munched the biscuit
she had taken from a neighboring table. And
again Eugène was conscious of an inexplicable
but very decided little thrill.</p>

<p>"If Mademoiselle Tournadour&mdash;if you, my
general, will consider me at your service, I
shall be glad to have you make use of my mare
Vivandière, here. She is as gentle as a lamb&mdash;but,
perhaps, not unworthy of being seen in
company with your own horse."</p>

<p>The General's eyes twinkled at the boyishness
of the remark. He knew a horse as well
as another, Vieux César, and to describe the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>superb Arab before him as being, perhaps, not
unworthy of being seen in company with his
own sturdy charger was a bit of satire much to
his relish.</p>

<p>"Merci!" he answered. "It is the proposal
of an officer and a gentleman. But my
daughter must decide if it is possible for us to
accept it. In the matter of names, monsieur,
you have me at an advantage."</p>

<p>"Pardon!" said the other. "I should have
realized that. I am Eugène Drouin, lieutenant
of the 29th Chasseurs."</p>

<p>"Natalie!" cried the General, beckoning
with his crop.</p>

<p>As Mademoiselle Tournadour came forward,
the young chasseur again made a confidant of
himself, this time for the satisfaction of observing
that he was an imbecile, and that a man
who could not tell at the first glance whether
or not a woman was entirely beautiful, deserved
not to have an opportunity of discovering the
fact at all. Their eyes met fairly, his glowing
with delighted surprise, hers touched with that
expression of negative inquiry and polite interest
which immediately precedes an introduction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>"My daughter," said the General, prodding
the air with his crop in her direction. "Lieutenant
Drouin, of the 29th Chasseurs," he
added, prodding again, in the direction of
Eugène. "Monsieur le lieutenant has been so
kind as to offer thee the use of his own horse,
and suggests that we leave Le Cid here to be
cared for until I can send Victor for him. I
tell him thou art the one to decide."</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you are truly kind," said the girl
easily&mdash;<em>too</em> easily, thought Eugène!&mdash;"but it
would be to presume upon your generosity."</p>

<p>"But it is nothing," protested the officer.
"Voyons! It is but a step to La Muette, and
there I have the Ceinture!"</p>

<p>"You are stationed at the quartier de cavalerie?"
asked Tournadour.</p>

<p>"Rue Desaix, yes, mon général," answered
Eugène. Then, turning again to the girl,
"Surely you must consent, mademoiselle. It is
the simplest way. And this afternoon, if you
will permit me"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes," put in the General, "and this afternoon
Victor can leave your horse at the caserne
as he is coming to take Le Cid.</p>

<p>"Eh, dis-donc, Natalie," he added, fretfully,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>observing that the girl still hesitated. "Don't
make difficulties, my dear. There is breakfast&mdash;yes,
breakfast to be considered, and it is one,
and past. Since the lieutenant is so kind"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Since the lieutenant is so kind," said his
daughter with a smile, "eh bien, I accept."</p>

<p>It was the work of a moment for Eugène to
shift the side-saddle from Le Cid to Vivandière.
The general had already mounted, and
was gazing off toward the porte Dauphine,
with his nose in the air, as if he scented breakfast
from afar.</p>

<p>"She is very beautiful, monsieur, your Vivandière,
and you are very good," said Mademoiselle
Tournadour, as the chasseur tightened the
girth, after her boot had touched his hand, and
she was in the saddle.</p>

<p>"She is very fortunate, mademoiselle," answered
Eugène, curiously embarrassed for one
so skilled in compliment. "If she wins, I
shall feel that she owes the race to this good
omen."</p>

<p>"The race?" said the girl.</p>

<p>"The Officers' Steeple Chase at Auteuil, on
Sunday."</p>

<p>"You ride her yourself?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>There was a strange little note of more than
casual interest in the question, and Eugène
looked up suddenly. For the second time
their eyes met.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Why? But nothing, monsieur, except, perhaps,
to wish you bonne chance."</p>

<p>She touched Vivandière with her heel.</p>

<p>"Adieu, monsieur," she added, "and a thousand
thanks!"</p>

<p>Eugène bowed.</p>

<p>"For nothing," he said, "and au revoir, mademoiselle!"</p>

<p>Then he watched them out of sight, with his
arm through Le Cid's bridle-rein, and his trim
English saddle sprawling at his feet.</p>

<p>There was something delightfully ingenuous,
to Eugène's way of thinking, in Vieux César's
method of unloading the burden of his embarrassment
on the shoulders of the first young
lieutenant who crossed his path, and then
riding off serenely to breakfast, leaving the
other, as it were, to gather up and disentangle
the loose ends of the situation. He was half
amused, half annoyed that his offer of Vivandière
had not been taken less as a matter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>course; but, in view of the circumstances, he
attended with fairly good grace to the details
of stabling Le Cid, and arranging to send for
his saddle, and then struck out at a swinging
gait for the footpath to La Muette. For all of
which there was a sufficient reason in the person
of Mademoiselle Tournadour.</p>

<p>Now, as he revolved the meeting in his
mind, he found that it was not in the least degree
a surprise. Somehow, he had always expected
that this girl would step suddenly into
his life, with her ruddy hair and her gray eyes.
It seemed to him to be something which the
natural evolution of that life demanded. He
had sounded every note in the gamut of emotions
appropriate to a man in his position. He
had had his serious, almost ascetic moods,
his despondencies, his flights of folly, his impulses
of stern ambition, his hours of morbid
brooding and of reckless gayety. He could
no longer number his love-affairs with any
approach to accuracy. They were hopelessly
jumbled in his memory, by very reason of their
number and their triviality. Here and there,
a face stood out from its fellows&mdash;the Baronne
de Banis, Lady Mary Kaswellyn, Rosa de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>Mirecourt, or the Marquise de Baucheron&mdash;but
none of these impelled him to regret.
There were no entanglements, no uncomfortable
circumstances to recall. Not a stone lay
in the way of the gate of the future, as, in his
imagination, it swung open before him. As
we have said, the fates were kind to Lieutenant
Eugène Drouin. The current of experience
had borne his individual shallop over
deeps and shallows safely and with a song,
and, now that a sudden turn of the stream had
shown him Natalie Tournadour waiting on the
bank, it seemed to him to be the most natural
thing imaginable,&mdash;something which intuition
had taught him was inevitable, and, what was
better, which experience told him was desirable.
The event had found him ready and willing
to make room for her beside him in the
boat, and, so, continue the journey in her company,
well content. He bowed to fate politely,
with a graceful merci!</p>

<p>For forty-eight hours he watched, almost as
if he had been a disinterested outsider, this
pleasant fancy moulding the details of his future
life. He reckoned his rentes anew, assigning
a due proportion to a little hôtel in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>Monceau quarter, to a villa at Houlgate, to
horses, household expenses, his wife's allowance,
servants, entertainment, a month at Aix,
another at Nice, a third at Hombourg. He
saw himself retired, and in the Chambre. And
over all hovered, like a luminous presiding angel,
the presence of Mademoiselle Tournadour&mdash;Madame
Drouin!</p>

<p>So Sunday came, and, with it, breakfast at
Armenonville with two fellow officers, and the
growing exhilaration of the approaching race.
Eugène was in his gayest mood&mdash;for was not
Vivandière not only the winner of last year's
Steeple Chase, but to-day in better form than
she had ever been? But he allowed his good
spirits to be touched, now and again, with a
gentle, pleasurable melancholy, as the violins
of the tziganes glided into the long, languorous
swell of the Valse Bleue, and his handsome
eyes clouded thoughtfully, and his fine mouth
drooped, so that Gaston Cavaignac rallied him
joyously upon the new affair, which alone could
account for such tristesse. It lent an added
zest, this. Eugène smiled, and was glad that
in his denial of the charge rang so little of conviction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>The first race had been already run, as the
three officers slipped through the main entrance
of Auteuil, and made their way across
the pesage, and past the betting booths, to the
grass oval around which the horses, in charge
of stable lads, were slowly circling. It was
one of May's clearest and most brilliant afternoons.
The gravel pathways and stretches of
vivid turf were thronged with the best known
men and women of the two great Parisian
worlds of sport and fashion, and the air rang
with gay gossip and spirited discussion. But
Eugène had ears for none of this, and eyes but
for two things,&mdash;Vivandière, blanketed, and
swinging around the oval with her long, sure
stride, and Natalie Tournadour, in a delicious
gown of soft blue, standing at the side of Vieux
César. Life, at that moment, was good to live.
The chasseur drew a quick breath of pleased
surprise. She was there, then, to see him win.
He might have known!</p>

<p>A mixture of sudden, unfamiliar embarrassment
and boyish vanity caused him to avoid
her eye as he made a turn of the oval, consulting
with his stable lad about the mare's condition;
but he held himself very straight, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>was pleasantly conscious that his tunic was
new, and his boots a veritable triumph of Coquillot's.
When he went back to his companions
his eyes were glowing.</p>

<p>"Content?" asked Cavaignac.</p>

<p>"Je te crois, mon vieux!" he answered.
"One never can say, but it is certain that no
one has a better chance. She is perfection!"</p>

<p>"There is the white," put in Lieutenant
Mors, dubiously.</p>

<p>Eugène vouchsafed the rival racer a brief,
contemptuous glance. It was a lean, powerfully
built brute, with an astonishing reach to even
the leisurely stride with which he paced the
oval. A trainer would have had something to
say of those lithe shoulders, and that long barrel,
dwindling along the flanks, and that easy
swing of haunch and swathed hock. But Eugène
was not a trainer.</p>

<p>"A fine animal," he observed, carelessly,
"but there is no comparison. One has only
to look at Vivandière."</p>

<p>"Tiens!" cried Gaston, "the saddling-bell!
I am off to put five louis on you gagnant, and
five placé. Bonne chance, vieux!"</p>

<p>In truth, the saddling-bell was jangling from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>the little pavilion to the left, and the officers
hurrying forward to weigh in. As he passed
into the enclosure, Eugène glanced over his
shoulder. General Tournadour and his daughter
were still standing at the oval-side, and he
had a glimpse of Natalie clapping her hands
and pointing, as the stable lad slipped the
blanket off Vivandière. But he made no sign,
even when, three minutes later, he mounted,
within five metres of where they stood. Time
enough, when the victory was won, to claim his
reward in the gray eyes of which he had been
dreaming. His heart leaped, nevertheless, as
he gave Vivandière the rein. It was the voice
of Vieux César, almost at his side:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be not afraid, ma petite. There is no doubt
that he is going to win."</p>

<p>No doubt, indeed, with her eyes upon him,
and her heart praying for his success!</p>

<p>Once upon the course, he swept the vast enclosure
with a glance, and his blood danced
with the excitement of the moment, and the
brilliancy of the scene. To the right the great
tribunes of the pesage, and the chair-dotted turf
in front, glowed with a shifting rainbow of
spring gowns and vivid parasols, and sparkled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>with a myriad white waistcoats, drifting, like
large, lazy snowflakes, to and fro; to the left
lay the vast enclosure of the pelouse, flooded
with dazzling sunlight, its thousands circling
here and there like ants. Beyond, the race-course
swept away, smooth and green, to the
long rows of trees in their new foliage, banked
along the route de Boulogne and the allée
des Fortifications. It was a day of days, whether
one stood inside the rail, straining for a
glimpse of the horses, or swept slowly to the
left, on the course itself, toward the starting
point, with a thoroughbred's flanks quivering
between one's knees!</p>

<p>As the horses circled about the start, getting
into position, Eugène's keen, handsome eyes
were busy with trivial details, dwindled by distance
to mere specks,&mdash;two men, leaning far
over the rails, signaling bets to each other
across the track, a gleam of orange from the
finish flag, the starter rocking toward him on a
ridiculously fat pony. Then, in an instant,
every faculty came taut like a stretched string,
and they were off, in a thunder of hoofs and a
whirl of flying sod. He saw a red flag fluttering
stiffly in the breeze as he swept past, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>heard, in the distance, the whirr of the signal
gong from the judge's stand. It was a fair
start. He touched Vivandière lightly with his
hand, and, at the signal, felt her lengthen under
him into her long, magnificent gallop. The
tribunes and the crowded pelouse rushed down
upon him with a murmur of many voices. The
long double line of faces at the rail slid past
like white dots, and the dark green hedge of
the water-jump sprang out of the track at his
feet. Houp, ma belle! A whish of brushed
twigs, a gleam of silver water passing under,
a thud of hoofs on the soft turf beyond, and
they were over, and away into the southern
loop to the left!</p>

<p>As he swung to the north again, he saw the
ants of the pelouse scurrying across to the rail
along the transverse cut. Let them run, les
drôles! They had need to if they would see
the passing of Vivandière! Past the high hurdle&mdash;so
much the better that one did not have
to take it!&mdash;and down the transverse to the
second water-jump. It was easy, that. The
mare crossed it like a bird, and Eugène saw
the tribunes again from the corner of his eye,
and laughed at the shrill "Bravo!" of a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>grisette in a red hat, who flew past him, leaning
on the rail.</p>

<p>Vivandière was well into the left reach of the
northern loop before Eugène fairly realized
what that smooth, empty width of turf before
him meant. He was leading,&mdash;had been
leading from the very start! And somewhere,
back there in the gay throng of the pesage, two
gray eyes were watching him, straining to catch
each movement of the blue tunic, each bound
of the gallant mare. He threw back his head
and laughed at the clear, wide sky. It was
very good to be alive!</p>

<p>So, with a broad sweep to the right, into the
home stretch, the last curve of the giant "8"
he had described. It lay ahead, full and fair,
cut by one low hedge. And then&mdash;</p>

<p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p>

<p>The sound battered its way into the chasseur's
understanding, and hurt as if it had been,
in verity, that of blow on blow. He leaned
forward, spurring the mare to her utmost endeavor.
And she responded, but still the beat
of following hoofs grew louder. For Vivandière
was thoroughbred, and she had kept her
maddest pace from the start. It was reserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>for racers of ignobler spirit to hold their greatest
effort for the end.</p>

<p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p>

<p>Once more pesage and pelouse rushed down
upon him, not now with a murmur of voices,
but with a mighty roar, that swelled, deafening,
into his ears.</p>

<p>"Flambeau! Flambeau! C'est Flambeau
qui gagne!"</p>

<p>There was a gasp of short-coming breath at
his elbow, a gleam of white, tense neck, a flash
of red breeches and of polished boots, and the
Steeple Chase Militaire was run, with Vivandière
second, and the lean, white Flambeau
winner by a length.</p>

<p>The officers rode back slowly, past the applauding
tribunes. Eugène saw dimly that it
was a colonel of infantry who rode Flambeau,
a metre ahead of him, but his thoughts were
more for Natalie than for himself or his successful
competitor. Poor little girl! She had
been so anxious for his victory, and no doubt
so confident, after the brave words of Vieux
César. But, after all,&mdash;second! It was not
so bad in a field of twelve. But he had been
wrong not to speak to her before he mounted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>Well, he would atone for that, never fear!
Moreover, when once they were married, he
would give her Vivandière&mdash;the cause of their
first meeting&mdash;the reason of their present sympathy!
It was a good thought.</p>

<p>Eugène did not find the general and his
daughter readily in the vast throng in the pesage.
Three times he made the circuit of the
tribunes, scanning the tiers of seats, and threading
his way through the little wooden chairs
upon the turf in front. Once he passed Cavaignac
and Mors, walking arm in arm, who
swore at him picturesquely for his defeat. Vivandière
had paid but seventeen francs fifty
placé, and so they had only seventy-five to
show for the five louis they had placed upon
her gagnant. The privilege of calling her master
tête de laitue was but trifling recompense,
and they strolled on, surprised that one noted
for his eloquence in this variety of obloquy did
not deign to reply.</p>

<p>Finally, at the doors of the little refreshment
pavilion, and talking with a colonel of infantry,
he found the objects of his quest, and went up
eagerly, saluting. Vieux César greeted him
with heartiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, lieutenant! Our preserver of Friday&mdash;quoi?
Natalie, see who is here&mdash;our preserver
of Friday!"</p>

<p>The girl was radiant. Her cheeks were
flushed, and the gray eyes shone with a brightness
that set Eugène's heart pounding so hard
that he felt its throbbing must be dimpling the
breast of his tunic.</p>

<p>"What a magnificent race!" she said, giving
him her hand. "You have cause to be proud of
Vivandière. It is something to have ridden
such a horse."</p>

<p>"It is always something to ride a good
horse," said Eugène, looking into her eyes,
"and it is something, also, to be second in a
good race, but it is more to be first. And I
had my reasons for wishing to be that, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>Natalie smiled.</p>

<p>"Ah, sans doute!" she answered. "But
you must not call me mademoiselle, monsieur.
You must know that since yesterday I am a
serious married woman. And what is more, my
husband rode Flambeau! Am I not a veritable
mascotte?"</p>

<p>She laid her hand on the arm of the officer
at her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>

"My husband, Colonel Montrésor," she
added. "Paul, this is the officer of whom I
spoke to you&mdash;who was so kind&mdash;Lieutenant"&mdash;</p>

<p>She turned to Eugène, blushing divinely,
with an embarrassed little laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, pray forgive me!" she said. "I am
<em>so</em> stupid&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;I have forgotten your
name!"</p>

<h2><a id="Papa_Labesse"></a>Papa Labesse</h2>

<p class="dropcap">UP on the Butte Montmartre life is a
matter of first principles, and conventionality
an undiscovered affliction. A
spade is a spade, and the blacker it happens
to be, the more apt it is to receive its proper
appellation, and the less likely to be confused
with the hearts and diamonds. That is why
Papa Labesse had no hesitation in referring to
Bombiste Fremier as a good-for-nothing,&mdash;a
vaurien.</p>

<p>Just off the boulevard de Rochechouart, in
the rue Veron, Papa Labesse kept a tiny joiner's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>shop, in which, in his velvet cap with a
long tassel and his ample apron of blue denim,
he might be seen daily, toiling upon various
small orders for the quartier. But daily, also,
when the light began to fail, he would discard
his apron, and, locking his shop door, walk
slowly up the long curving incline of the rue
Lepic, and through the appropriately rural-looking
rue St. Rustique, until he emerged
upon the broad summit of the Butte. Here he
would light his pipe, and, with his legs spread
wide, stand motionless by the low wattled fence
at the brink of the bluff, looking off across the
city. In appearance Papa Labesse was not
the type of man in whom one would be apt to
look for sentimentality. He was short and
very thin, with a hooked nose and a gray moustache
turned up fiercely at the ends, and his
skin was brown and deeply wrinkled, as if he
had somehow shrunk or warped; but then, as
Marcelle said of him, it is the rough and crinkled
Brazil-nut that is as full as possible of
sweet white meat.</p>

<p>Between these two there had always existed
a firm bond of camaraderie. Marcelle was the
daughter of Madame Clapot, who presided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>over a little dairy directly opposite the joiner's
shop, and on the day when she first made the
astounding discovery that small girls can stand
upright and walk alone, as if by instinct she
had made a bee-line for the doorway of Papa
Labesse, and, staggering in, triumphant, had
fallen headlong, with a gurgle of satisfaction,
into a great pile of shavings. Thenceforward
she came often and tarried long, and Papa Labesse
built houses for her out of odds and
ends of wood, and fashioned miniature articles
of furniture in his spare moments, and had
always a bit of sucre-candi or a little gingerbread
figure tucked away in a certain drawer of
his table, which she soon learned to find for
herself.</p>

<p>It seemed to Papa Labesse but the week following
her first plunge among his shavings
when Marcelle came in, all in white, and with
a veil like a little bride's, to parade her splendor
under his delighted eyes, before going to
her first communion. But when he put into her
hand the small white prayerbook he had bought
for this great occasion, she had forgotten all
else, and thrown her arms about his neck, entirely
regardless of her finery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>"After maman, thou knowest, Papa Labesse,
I love thee best of all the world!"</p>

<p>And Papa Labesse was properly shocked at
this recklessness and said, bon Dieu! that was
a fine veil, then, made to be crushed against an
odious apron covered with chips and sawdust&mdash;what?
And, as Marcelle ran off to join
Madame Clapot, who was waiting, consumed
with mingled pride and impatience, across the
way, the old man wiped his spectacles vigorously,
shook his head several times, and then,
suddenly abandoning his work, three hours before
the accustomed time, betook himself to
the Butte, and smoked three pipefuls of tobacco,
looking off across the city.</p>

<p>It was at this time that two radical changes
came into the life of Papa Labesse. First, on
the very summit of the Butte they began to lay
the foundations for the great church of Sacré-C&oelig;ur;
and, second, Marcelle took it into her
pretty little head to accompany him on his daily
climb. At first he was disturbed by both these
innovations. This curious afternoon communion
of his with the wonderful wide city, which
lay spread out before him like a great gray
map, was akin to a religion. He loved Paris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>with a love so great that perhaps he himself
was barely able to comprehend its proportions.
He was never tired of standing there and
watching her breathing at his feet, of picking
out, in the gathering twilight, the faint white
speck to the west that was the arc de l'Etoile,
the domes of the Invalides and the Panthéon,
Notre Dame, to the eastward, and the towers
and spires of half a hundred minor temples
and public buildings. He passed from one to
the other in a kind of visual pilgrimage, saying
the names over slowly to himself, and occasionally
affecting an air of surprise, as if some
one of the familiar piles had suddenly and unaccountably
appeared in a new locality.</p>

<p>"La Trinité; Notre Dame de Lorette; La
Bourse. Tiens! <em>St. Eustache!</em>"</p>

<p>At the outset, the serenity of this contemplative
hour was seriously impaired by the creaking
of derrick-pulleys and the loud chatter of
wagon-drivers, and hardly less so by the eager
questions of Marcelle, clinging to his hand,
her eyes bright with excitement, as she looked
out with him across Paris, or peered down into
the vast pit when the masons were laying the
foundations of the big church. But, bit by bit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>Papa Labesse became accustomed to the new
conditions; and every night, an hour before
sunset, his high, dry voice summoned Marcelle
from the dairy across the way, and the two set
forth together up the long curving incline of
the rue Lepic, and the old man would smoke
his pipe by the low wattled fence at the brink
of the bluff, while the child babbled of her little
affairs. Papa Labesse no longer named the
domes and spires now. His eyes rested alternately
on the city and on the girl beside him,
and often, when Marcelle was silent, looking
off to where the thin, silver line of the Seine
gleamed briefly between distant buildings, he
shook his head several times, tapping the side
of his inverted pipe-bowl against the palm of
his hand, long after the ashes had fallen out.</p>

<p>When Marcelle was seventeen, Madame Clapot
died suddenly, and the girl moved from the
rue Veron to the home of her aunt, near by, in
the rue Seveste. But the change made no difference
in her friendship for Papa Labesse.
All through the ensuing spring she called regularly
for him each afternoon, and they climbed
the Butte in company, as before. The old man
would have been completely happy had it not
been for Bombiste Fremier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<p>Bombiste was an employé of the state,&mdash;an
humble one, to be sure, but, nevertheless, part
and parcel of the great Administration which
includes every one, from the President of the
Republic to the street-sweeper on the rue
Royale. In Fremier's case the employment
was brief and not over-lucrative. He was engaged,
for two months only in the twelve, to
mow the grass on the fortifications and in parts
of the Bois and the smaller parks of Paris.
For the remainder of the year he lived none
knew how, but he had always a few white
pieces in his pocket, and was ready to treat a
comrade at Le Cheval Blanc, the little wine-shop
kept by Bonhomme Pirou at the corner
of the boulevard and the rue Seveste. As regards
the source of his income, it is probable
that Amélie Chouert, called La Trompette, by
reason of her loud voice, might have divulged
some remarkable particulars. In any event,
she was his constant companion, a sharp-featured,
angular woman with snapping black eyes
and a great mop of hair that came down to
within an inch of her continuous line of eyebrow.</p>

<p>Fremier himself was as handsome as a brutal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>picture,&mdash;a giant in stature, with square
shoulders, a thick neck, in which the muscles
stood out like ropes, and the face of an Italian
brigand. It is a type of masculine beauty
which goes far in Montmartre, and to it was
added a deep, melodious voice, that, whether
in the heat of political argument or the more
complicated phraseology of love, carried complete
conviction. No one blamed La Trompette
for her infatuation. As we have said,
life on the Butte is a matter of first principles,
and, in view of the manifest attraction, her
position was entirely conceivable. Except to
Papa Labesse.</p>

<p>He was a singularly rigid old man, who took
no account of the remarkable beauty and the
irresistible tongue of Fremier, but only of the
fact that he was called Bombiste because he
talked against the government at Le Cheval
Blanc, advocating the use of dynamite, and
only the bon Dieu knew what else beside.
And if, as La Trompette alleged, he swung
his scythe on the fortifications like a veritable
demon, what of that? No, evidently he was a
vaurien!</p>

<p>So it was, that when, one fine May afternoon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>Papa Labesse, emerging from his little
shop at the summons of Marcelle, caught a
glimpse of Bombiste slipping around the further
corner into the rue Lepic, his heart gave
a sudden great bound and then seemed to
stand still. He was very silent on the way to
the Butte, for, moment by moment, the blackness
of untoward premonition was settling
upon him. He glanced, covertly, but again
and again, at Marcelle, observing, with a
strange, suddenly acquired power of perception,
that she was already a woman. He had
not seemed to notice, day by day, the change
in her. Now it dawned upon him in a flash.
No, it was no longer the baby who had fallen
headlong among his shavings, nor yet the child
going to her first communion, all in white and
with a veil like a little bride's, nor even the
slender girl who had peered down with him
into the vast pit where the masons were laying
the foundations of the big church. It was a
woman who walked beside him, a woman very
beautiful, with dark hair, coiled above a pale,
pure face, and great eyes, like crushed violets
swimming in their dew. Papa Labesse caught
his breath: Bombiste Fremier!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>But Marcelle saw nothing of her companion's
preoccupation. She almost danced beside
him up the long curving incline of the rue
Lepic, chaffing, as she passed, the children
playing in the gutters, and pausing continually
to sniff at some flower-vender's fragrant wares,
or peer into the window of a tiny shop. She
was glowing with health and happiness: her
cheeks dappled with color, her eyes shining.
When, finally, they emerged upon the Butte,
she ran to the little wattled fence, and with
her hands clasped behind her head, looked out
across the city. Even when Papa Labesse had
come up to her side, she said no word for several
minutes.</p>

<p>They had started later than was usual, and
already the daylight had begun to dim, and the
west to turn from red to saffron, and from saffron
to fawn. Directly below them lay a maze
of steep and narrow streets, shelving toward
the boulevard de Rochechouart; and far further,
to the southwest, the place de l'Opéra was
breaking into the alternate deep red and glaring
white of electric advertising signs, the lettering
of which could not be distinguished from
where they stood, but which painted the faint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>haze of evening with swiftly changing contrasts
of color.</p>

<p>Suddenly Marcelle began to speak, her voice
eloquent with a strange, new music.</p>

<p>"Papa Labesse, dost thou comprehend what
all this says to us, this wonderful city upon
which we look each night, thou and I? From
here&mdash;what? A bewilderment of lights, a sea
of roofs, a murmur of faintly heard cries. But
what does it mean? Surely, it is the voice
of the mother of us all, of Paris, the great,
the beautiful&mdash;of a woman, Papa Labesse:
that finally, which thou canst never comprehend,
pauvre Papa Labesse!&mdash;a woman who
says but one word&mdash;love! Papa Labesse&mdash;L'amour,
l'amour, l'amour!&mdash;again, and again,
and again, l'amour!"</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Then, almost
timidly, Papa Labesse laid his hand on hers.</p>

<p>"But thou dost not love, my little one,&mdash;thou?"
he said.</p>

<p>Marcelle turned suddenly.</p>

<p>"Si, I love!" she answered.</p>

<p>Above the tapering, distant shaft of the
Tour Eiffel a tiny cloud caught the last ray of
the departed sun, blazed crimson for an instant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>and then, as suddenly, gloomed to slate-gray.</p>

<p>"Que Dieu te bénisse!" said Papa Labesse,
solemnly.</p>

<p>"It is all so wonderful," continued Marcelle
after a moment, "and yet I have never seemed
to understand it till to-day,&mdash;this great, sweet
voice of Paris. It is indeed as if she was the
mother of us all, Papa Labesse, and was
spreading out her arms, and calling us all to
come to her heart. And for each of us she
has something good&mdash;something better than
ever we have imagined for ourselves, or wished
to have; and yet, in whatever form, it is really
the same thing always&mdash;l'amour, Papa Labesse,
l'amour!"</p>

<p>Out of the strain of the past half hour a
great sob was suddenly wrung from Papa Labesse.
He took the girl's radiant face between
his knotted hands and looked long into her
eyes without speaking.</p>

<p>"Tell me, my pigeon," he said, finally, "is
it&mdash;is it the young Fremier?"</p>

<p>Marcelle flung both arms about his neck, as
she had done on the day when he had given her
the little white prayerbook. He felt her lips,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>warm and moist, against his wrinkled ear, and
when she spoke, her voice was like the sound
of two leaves grazing each other at the touch
of a light breeze.</p>

<p>"Oui!" she said.</p>

<p>When Marcelle went away with Bombiste
Fremier, all the quartier babbled. Fat fishwives
and dairywomen stopped at each others'
doors, and said, wisely, with their heads together
and hands on hips, that they had always
known how it would be. Since the first, whatever
Bombiste wanted, that Bombiste was sure
to have&mdash;what? Did not Madame Rollin remember
how, when a mere baby, he had cried
for the little brass dish which hung in front of
his father's salle de coiffure, until, actually,
Fremier père had taken it down and given it
to him to cut his first tooth on? Assuredly,
Madame Rollin recalled this astounding incident,
and not only that, but the fact that she
herself had spoken to Madame Fremier, warning
her that the result of such folly would be
the unhappiness of some one. But they were
all alike, the Fremier. They made no excuses
and took no advice.</p>

<p>There were others who recalled the days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>when La Trompette was the belle of the quartier,
and as respectable as the best of them.
But there, what wouldst thou? Bombiste had
wanted her, so there was nothing to be done.
And the debate invariably ended with a bit of
flattery for Bombiste. It was a beau garçon,
after all, name of a good name, with such eyes!
And a tongue, bon Dieu, to draw the cork from
a bottle! For there are many mysteries of
human society, but the greatest of these is the
good word of the other women for the man.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, Bombiste's most eloquent
partisan was La Trompette herself. Her first
appearance at Le Cheval Blanc, after Fremier's
desertion of her, was the signal for the outburst
of ironic condolence.</p>

<p>"Eh! La Trompette, he has planted thee&mdash;yes?
So the cord is cut, little one&mdash;hein?
Did he give thee a reference, at least?"</p>

<p>To these, and many similar compliments,
La Trompette returned nothing beyond a tolerant
smile, or&mdash;</p>

<p>"One shall see, my children!" she cried,
in her shrill voice. "It is not the first time,
you know. Variety, one has need of that in
life. Perhaps we do not know each other, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>story and I! Wait a little. In six weeks we
shall be here in company as before, and the
little one it will be who is planted. But I remain.
And she who laughs last&mdash;what? But,
above all, not a word against Bombiste, unless
you have need of the wherewithal to make
broken heads. It is a brave gars, do you understand,
and one who has often enough paid
your drinks, types of good-for-nothings!"</p>

<p>And she planted herself at a table amidst a
burst of laughter and applause (for loyalty is
greatly esteemed on the boulevard Rochechouart),
and proceeded to collect interest, in the
form of repeated glasses of cognac, on the
past generosities of Bombiste Fremier.</p>

<p>But the eternal feminine had its part in the
make-up of La Trompette, and so it was that
one evening, just at nightfall, she presented
herself at the door of Papa Labesse's little
shop. He was always at home now, poor Papa
Labesse, for the growing church of Sacré-C&oelig;ur
had never once seen him emerging, breathless
but smiling, from the little rue St. Rustique,
since the day when Marcelle disappeared. He
stopped his simple toil at the same hour still,
but, instead of stepping out briskly upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>long, curving incline of the rue Lepic, he would
seat himself in his doorway, and, oftentimes
forgetting to light the pipe which he had filled,
stare out wistfully across the street, to where a
trim little laundress stood, busily ironing shirts,
in the window of the shop that had formerly
been the dairy of Madame Clapot.</p>

<p>He looked up as La Trompette drew up before
his door, and a slight frown wrinkled for
an instant above his patient blue eyes, from
which all the singular intensity seemed gone.</p>

<p>"Thou hast a strange air of solitude, Papa
Labesse," began La Trompette, affecting a tone
of solicitude.</p>

<p>Papa Labesse made no reply.</p>

<p>"And Marcelle," said the woman,&mdash;"she is
always with Bombiste? Poor little one! The
end is so sure! Is there one who knows him
better than I? Ah, non! It is always the
same story,&mdash;a pair of bright eyes, a good
figure, and v'là! But, without fail, he comes
back to me, ce sacré coureur!"</p>

<p>She glanced up and down the street with an
air of complete unconcern, and then her eyes
came back to Papa Labesse with a vindictive
snap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<p>"Happily," she added, "he will have taught
her a way of earning white pieces in abundance.
She is not the first, thy Marcelle.
They are sprinkled from here to La Villette,
the gonzesses who know the name of Bombiste
Fremier. Wouldst thou prove it? Walk, then,
from the place Pigalle to the place de la Rotonde
to-night at twelve!" And La Trompette
laughed.</p>

<p>Papa Labesse rose suddenly to his full
height.</p>

<p>"God damn you!" he said. And this was
no oath, but rather a prayer.</p>

<p>Toward the end of July Papa Labesse resumed
his pilgrimages to the summit of the
Butte. He had aged visibly in six weeks, and
he walked no longer with the brisk and cheerful
step which had bespoken his youthfulness
of spirit, but shuffled his feet, and often stumbled
over trifling obstacles. He looked neither
to the right nor to the left, and if he heard the
greetings of those along his way, for whom
formerly he had always had a hearty word, he
made no reply. It is doubtful whether, had he
been suddenly asked, he could have told his
exact whereabouts: it was rather instinct than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>absolute intention which sent him shuffling up
to his old coign of vantage. His eyes took no
note of his immediate surroundings, but looked
far beyond, with an expression that was half
question, half entreaty. It was only when he
had come to the edge of the bluff that he
seemed to awaken into something resembling
the man he had been. Then, his lean, gnarled
hands gripped the wattles with a kind of convulsive
eagerness, and, for a little, the old blue
spark gleamed under his lids, and his eyes
swept the great city feverishly, as if they would
pluck out her secret from her by mere force of
will. He no longer dwelt upon the churches
and the public buildings, but traced with his
glance the line of the great boulevards, des
Batignolles, de Clichy, and de Rochechouart,
and their tributary streets; and often he remained
at his post until nearly midnight, motionless,
silent, watching, watching, watching,
with his eyes fixed upon the distant red glare
from the giant revolving wings of the brilliantly
lighted Moulin Rouge.</p>

<p>What he saw, what he heard, during those
long hours of vigil no one ever knew: what
he thought he barely knew himself. The entire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>intensity of his failing strength was concentrated
upon one endeavor. Hour after
hour he sent a voice without sound out, over,
and down into the labyrinth of streets beneath
him, into the dance-halls, the wine-shops, the
café-concerts, wooing, pleading, beseeching.
It was as if, minute by minute, he wove a great
net of tenderest entreaty and persuasion, fitting
it cunningly into each nook and cranny of
the city below, and then, at the end, with one
mighty effort of his will, drew the whole fabric
up and into his heart, hoping against hope that,
mysteriously, some one pleading thought of his
might have caught her and swept her back to
his arms. It was a struggle, silent but to the
death, between Papa Labesse and the great
siren city, for the possession of a soul.</p>

<p>And, as if, indeed, that eager voice without
words of his entreaty had, somehow, been able
to reach and win her, Marcelle came back. It
was at the hour just following sunset, the hour
they had loved to pass together, and superbly
still and clear. To the west, over the wide,
green sweep of the Bois de Boulogne, a great
multitude of little puffs of cloud lay piled up
against a turquoise sky, and these were constantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>changing from tint to opalescent tint, as
shafts of crimson and saffron sunlight moved
among them from below the horizon. Above,
where the turquoise dulled to steel, the stars
were already nicking the sky, one by one;
and, one by one, the lights of the boulevard,
red, white, and yellow, flashed into being in
reply.</p>

<p>As it was the dinner hour, the summit of the
Butte was deserted save for the figure of Papa
Labesse, silhouetted against the sky, as Marcelle
emerged from the rue St. Rustique, came
slowly across the open space before the church,
and stood at his side. She was very pale, with
the transparent, leaden pallor which comes only
at the end, and her face seemed little more than
two great, stunned eyes. Her clothes, in the
last stage of what had been tawdry finery, were
unspeakably more slovenly than mere rags. It
was but eight weeks since they had stood on
the same spot together, but this so brief period
had wrought in each the havoc of a decade.</p>

<p>For a time neither spoke. Papa Labesse
had looked up briefly as she reached his side,
and then, as she swayed and seemed about to
fall, had put an arm about her and drawn her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>close to him. So they stood watching, while
Paris winked and sparkled into the starry splendor
of her summer night. Finally,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I knew thou wouldst come, my pigeon,"
said Papa Labesse. "For a time I was desolate,
is it not so?&mdash;and sat alone in the shop
below there, and thought of nothing. But then
I remembered how that thou didst love this
place, and so I have come each night to wait
for thee, because I knew thou wouldst return.
And now thou art here. It is well, my little
white pigeon, it is very well."</p>

<p>A keener ear than his would have caught
the unmistakable warning that underlay her
voice when she replied. It lacked not only
hope, but life itself. It was the voice of one
long dead.</p>

<p>"I did not think to find thee here, Papa Labesse&mdash;it
has been so long since then. I
came to see it all once again&mdash;to hear the
voice of the great city that sings of love. And
then, when at last comes the night, I would
throw myself down from here, even into the
very heart of her, for I am hers, and she has
made me like herself."</p>

<p>She seemed to feel the unvoiced question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>which quivered on the lips of Papa Labesse,
and continued, presently,&mdash;</p>

<p>"He never married me. Not that I cared
for that. I loved him, thou seest, and when
one loves one thinks not of little things. No,
I was happy so. But now&mdash;last week he left
me. He has gone back to La Trompette. He
gave me a hundred sous. I think he was sorry
to go."</p>

<p>A faint smile touched the corners of her
lips.</p>

<p>"Pauvre Bombiste!" she added. "It is
one who does not know his own heart!"</p>

<p>And this again is unknowable mystery,&mdash;the
gentle word of <em>the</em> woman for the man!</p>

<p>"He is mowing on the fortifs this week,"
went on Marcelle, wistfully echoing her lover's
slang, "and La Trompette is with him. I saw
them but to-day, from the porte de Clichy. So,
since they are together, for me it is finished.
I have come back to the Butte, Papa Labesse&mdash;come
back to die. For now there is none to
receive me, save Paris. She will take me, thou
knowest, she who has made me like herself."</p>

<p>That was all. There was no word, now at
the end, of Bombiste Fremier, except that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>did not know his own heart,&mdash;no word of the
days without food, the long nights of following
him from wineshop to wineshop, perhaps to be
refused at last the wretched shelter of his little
room; no word of curses, blows, and insults
worse than either.</p>

<p>When she was silent again Papa Labesse
drew her gently away from the brink of the
bluff.</p>

<p>"My pigeon," he said, "there is one to receive
thee. Thou wilt come to the little shop&mdash;pas?&mdash;and
rest there upon my bed. For I
have no need of sleep, I. And in the morning
thou wilt be strong again, and well. Come,
my pigeon!"</p>

<p>And silently, hand in hand, they retraced the
familiar way, down the long, curving incline of
the rue Lepic, and the door of the little joiner's
shop closed behind them.</p>

<p>Marcelle died at daybreak, going out softly
like a lamp that dims and dims, and then flares
once into brilliance before all is dark. Papa
Labesse was on his knees beside the narrow
bed, when she woke from the stupor into which
she had fallen, and raised herself upright, her
face shining with a great light. The old man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>himself unconscious that the end had come,
lifted his eyes eagerly to hers.</p>

<p>"My little white pigeon," he said tremulously,
"thou findest thyself better, is it not so?"</p>

<p>But the knowledge of him had passed utterly
from Marcelle. For a moment she was silent,
looking at the wall of the tiny room, as she
had looked in the old days at the great city,
spread like a map at the foot of the Butte
Montmartre. Then she sank back upon the
pillow and crossed her hands upon her breast.</p>

<p>"Paris!" she said. "Paris, toi qui chantes
de l'amour!"</p>

<p>And then, very faintly, "Bombi!"</p>

<p>It was her pet name for Fremier, but Papa
Labesse did not understand.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, he came out into the
growing light of the dawn, and looked vacantly
up and down the short stretch of the rue Veron
as if uncertain what direction he desired to
take. It was not yet five o'clock, but already
the quartier was astir. As Papa Labesse hesitated
in the doorway, a band of laborers passed
the corner, laughing, on their way to their work
in the Rochechouart section of the Métropolitain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>The little assistant was taking down the
shutters of the laundry across the way, and on
every side was the sound of opening doors and
windows, and voices suddenly raised in greeting
or comment upon the weather. Madame
Rollin lumbered by, carrying a bundle of
clothes on her way to the public lavoir.</p>

<p>"Hé! bonjour, Papa Labesse!" she cried
in passing. "A fine morning&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>Papa Labesse turned suddenly, clamped the
padlock on his door, and was presently shuffling
along the avenue de Clichy. As he went,
the city awoke around him to full activity, but
he noted his surroundings even less than he had
been wont to do of late, on his climbs to the
Butte. The return of Marcelle had quickened
him, but for a moment only. Now he was
again, as it were, a mere automaton, going forward
without volition, or purpose, or perception,
on, on, on, whither and why he knew not.</p>

<p>After a time he was conscious of a great
weariness. The noisy clamor of the crowds on
the avenue, marketing and bargaining in the
new sunlight, seemed unaccountably to have
given place to quiet; and looking about him,
Papa Labesse learned from a little signboard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>that he was passing through the porte de Clichy.
The octroi officials looked curiously at
the shuffling, stooping figure as he went by,
and one of them laughed.</p>

<p>"As full as an egg, the grandfather!" he
said.</p>

<p>Turning to the left, Papa Labesse toiled up
upon the slope of the fortifications, stumbled
on for a little, and, finally, as his exhaustion
gained upon him, flung himself, face down,
upon the grass. He had passed the need of
sleep long since, but he lay quite motionless
for a long time, with his chin on his hands.
Directly before him, seen more clearly from
the elevation upon which he lay, was the dingy
suburb of Clichy, and, to the left, its still dingier
neighbor, Levallois-Perret, studded, both
of them, with gaunt sheds of blackened wood,
and ghastly factories and storehouses of cheap
brick, their endless windows, in close-set rows,
giving them the appearance of rusted waffle-irons,
and their tall chimneys slabbering slow
coils of smoke. In the immediate foreground,
a man with a scythe was lazily cutting the long
grass on the outward slope of the fortifications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>Presently Papa Labesse began to talk to
himself. His eyes were very bright, and as he
spoke they jumped nimbly from shed to shed,
from factory to factory, of the dispiriting scene
before him.</p>

<p>"But what are those?" he began, scowling
at two high chimneys standing side by side.
"Tiens! Sainte Clotilde! But the evening is
clear then, par exemple, that one sees so far
and so well. It is all so wonderful&mdash;but I
have never understood it till now. Ah! Saint
Etienne-du-Mont! That I know, since the
dome of the Panthéon is quite near. Sapristi!
What is that? L'amour, Papa Labesse, l'amour,&mdash;that
which, finally, thou canst never understand,
poor Papa Labesse! Tiens! Notre
Dame! Ah, ça! A woman like herself, what?&mdash;like
Paris that sings of love! My pigeon!"</p>

<p>So, for an hour, the thin stream of jumbled
phrases slipped from his dry lips. He talked
softly,&mdash;no one could have heard him at two
paces,&mdash;but the babble never ceased.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock a woman carrying a basket
appeared upon the fortifications from the direction
of the gate, and, pausing at the top of the
slope, looked down upon the mower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span></p>

<p>"Hé! Allô&mdash;labago! Bom-biste!" she
cried. The man turned. There was no such
thing as not being able to hear La Trompette.</p>

<p>And suddenly Papa Labesse held his peace.</p>

<p>Bombiste came up the slope with a long leisurely
stride, flung his scythe upon the grass,
and placing his arm around La Trompette's
neck, kissed her loudly on both cheeks.</p>

<p>"Name of God!" he said. "But I have
thirst!"</p>

<p>They seated themselves side by side and
close together, with their backs to Papa Labesse,
some fifty metres distant, and La Trompette
opened her basket. Presently Bombiste
lowered his left elbow and raised his right in
the act of drawing a cork, and then raised his
left again and took a long draught from the
bottle. At the same moment Papa Labesse
swung round a quarter circle to the right, as if
upon a pivot, and began to crawl very slowly
forward.</p>

<p>"Chouette!" said Bombiste to La Trompette,
biting a great mouthful from a slice of
rye bread and cheese, "c'est du suisse!"</p>

<p>"Thou deservest water and a raw turnip!"
replied the woman, assuming a tone of angry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>reproach. "If it were not I, thou knowest,
long since thou wouldst have been put ashore,
heart of an artichoke&mdash;va!"</p>

<p>"I am like that," observed Bombiste, with
regret. "But what wouldst thou, name of God!
They come, they go: but at the end it is always
thou."</p>

<p>The woman made no reply, and Papa Labesse,
two metres away, laid his gnarled brown
fingers on the handle of Bombiste's discarded
scythe.</p>

<p>Bombiste capped his philosophy with a second
long draught of wine, and then, taking a
stupendous bite of bread and cheese, glanced
slyly at his companion out of the corners of
his eyes. She was gazing straight before her,
her teeth nicking the edge of her lower lip.</p>

<p>"What hast thou?" mumbled the man, with
his mouth full.</p>

<p>"She was very pretty," answered La Trompette,
"and she loved thee, that garce. But
thou art going to tell me that it is finished
forever!&mdash;That never, never," she went on,
clenching her hands, "wilt thou see her again!
Else I plant thee, and thou canst earn thine
own white pieces,&mdash;mackerel!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>

Bombiste leaned over and placed his face
beside hers.</p>

<p>"Is it not enough?" he said in his softest
voice. "Voyons bien! What is she to me,
this Marcelle? Fichtre! I planted her last
week, thou knowest. B'en, quoi? Thou knowest
the blue gown? It is that which sweeps
the Boul' Roch' at present! But that is not
for long. Perhaps the Morgue&mdash;more likely
St. Lazare. Art thou not content?" And he
pressed his cheek to the woman's and moved
his head up and down slowly, caressing her.</p>

<p>Papa Labesse rose slowly to his feet, and
stretched his lean arms to their full length.
The sun winked for the fraction of a second
on the downward swirling scythe, and then all
was still, save for the dull thud, thudding of
two round objects rolling down the uneven
slope of sod. In a moment even this sound
ceased.</p>

<p>Papa Labesse revolved slowly upon his heels,
pausing as his blue eyes, wide and vacant, fell
upon the distant walls of Sacré-C&oelig;ur, swimming,
cream-white and high in air, between
him and the sun. Then he pitched softly forward
upon the grass.</p>

<h2><a id="In_the_Absence_of_Monsieur"></a>In the Absence
of Monsieur</h2>

<p class="dropcap">MONSIEUR ARMAND MICHEL&mdash;seated
before his newly installed Titian&mdash;was
in the act of saying to
himself that if its acquisition could not, with
entire accuracy, be viewed as an unqualified
bargain, it had been, at least, an indisputable
stroke of diplomacy, when his complacent
meditation was interrupted by the entrance of
Arsène. It was the first time that Monsieur
Michel had seen his new servant in his official
capacity, and he was not ill-pleased. Arsène
was in flawless evening dress, in marked contrast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>to the objectionably flamboyant costume
in which, on the preceding evening, he had
made application for the position of valet-maître
d'hôtel, left vacant by the fall from
grace of Monsieur Michel's former factotum.
That costume had come near to being his undoing.
The fastidious Armand had regarded
with an offended eye the brilliant green cravat,
the unspeakable checked suit, and the painfully
pointed chrome-yellow shoes in which the
applicant for his approval was arrayed, and
more than once, in the course of conversation,
was on the point of putting a peremptory end
to the negotiations by a crushing comment on
would-be servants who dressed like café chantant
comedians. But the reference had outweighed
the costume. Monsieur Michel did
not remember ever to have read more unqualified
commendation. Arsène Sigard had been
for two years in the service of the Comte de
Chambour, whose square pink marble hôtel on
the avenue de Malakoff is accounted, in this
degenerate age, one of the sights of Paris;
and this of itself, was more than a little. The
Comte did not keep his eyes in his pockets,
by any manner of means, when it came to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>affairs of his household, and apparently there
was nothing too good for him to say about
Arsène. Here, on pale blue note-paper, and
surmounted by the de Chambour crest, it was
set forth that the bearer was sober, honest,
clean, willing, capable, quiet, intelligent, and
respectful. <em>And</em> discreet. When the Comte
de Chambour gave his testimony on this last
point it meant that you were getting the opinion
of an expert. Monsieur Michel refolded
the reference, tapped it three times upon the
palm of his left hand, and engaged the bearer
without further ado.</p>

<p>Now, as Arsène went quietly about the salon,
drawing the curtains and clearing away
the card table, which remained as mute witness
to Monsieur Michel's ruling passion, he was
the beau idéal of a gentleman's manservant,&mdash;unobtrusive
in manner and movement, clean-shaven
and clear-eyed, adapting himself without
need of instruction to the details of his
new surroundings. A less complacent person
than Armand might have been aware that,
while he was taking stock of Arsène, Arsène
was taking stock, with equal particularity, of
him. And there was an unpleasant slyness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>in his black eyes, a something akin to alertness
in his thin nostrils, which moved like those
of a rabbit, and seemed to accomplish more
than their normal share of conveying to their
owner's intelligence an impression of exterior
things. Also, had Monsieur Michel but observed
it, his new servant walked just a trifle
<em>too</em> softly, and his hands were just a trifle <em>too</em>
white and slender. Moreover, he had a habit
of smiling to himself when his back was turned,
which is an undesirable thing in anybody, and
approaches the ominous in a valet-maître d'hôtel.
But Monsieur Michel was far too much
of an aristocrat to have any doubt of his power
to overawe and impress his inferiors, or to
see in the newcomer's excessive inconspicuity
anything more than a commendable recognition
of monsieur's commanding presence. So,
when Arsène completed his work and had shut
the door noiselessly behind him, his master
rubbed his hands and said "Ter-rès bien!"
in a low voice, this being his superlative expression
of satisfaction. Had his glance been
able to penetrate his salon door, it would have
met, in the antichambre, with the astounding
spectacle of his new servant in the act of tossing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>monsieur's silk hat into the air, and catching
it, with extreme dexterity, on the bridge of
his nose. Unfortunately, the other side of the
door is something which, like the future and
the bank-accounts of our debtors, it is not
given us to see. So Monsieur Michel repeated
his "Ter-rès bien!" and fell again to contemplating
his Titian.</p>

<p>Yes, undoubtedly, it had been a great stroke
of diplomacy. The young Marchese degli Abbraccioli
was not conspicuous for his command
of ready money, but his father had left him the
finest private collection of paintings in Rome,
and this, in consequence of chronic financial
stress, was gradually passing from the walls of
his palazzo in the via Cavour into the possession
of an appreciative but none too extravagant
government. It had been an inspiration,
this proposal of Monsieur Michel's to settle
his claim upon the Marchese for his overwhelming
losses at baccarat by taking over
one of the two Titians which flanked the chimney-piece
in his study. The young Italian had
assented eagerly, and had supplemented his
acquiescence with a proposal to dispose of the
pendant for somewhat more material remuneration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>than canceled reconnaissances. But Armand
Michel had undertaken it before, this
delicate task of getting objets d'art over the
Italian frontier&mdash;yes, and been caught in the
act, too, and forced to disgorge. For the moment,
it was enough to charge himself with one
picture, on the given conditions, without risking
hard cash in the experiment. Later&mdash;well,
later, one would see. And so, <em>a rivederla, mio
caro marchese</em>.</p>

<p>Monsieur Michel fairly hugged himself as
he thought of his success. Mon Dieu, quelle
génie, that false bottom to his trunk! He had
come safely through them all, the imbecile inspectors,
and now his treasure hung fairly and
finally upon his wall, smiling at him out of its
tapestry surroundings. It was épatant, truly,
and moreover, all there was of the most calé.
Only one small cloud of regret hung upon the
broad blue firmament of his satisfaction&mdash;the
other picture! It had been so easy. He
might as well have had two as one. And now,
without doubt, the imbecile Marchese would
sell the pendant to the imbecile government,
and that would be the end of it so far as private
purchase was concerned. Monsieur Michel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>rose from his chair with a gesture of impatience,
and, drawing the curtain back from
the window, looked out lugubriously upon the
March cheerlessness of the place Vendôme.
Little by little, a most seductive plan formed
itself in his mind. After all, why not? A
couple of weeks at Monte Carlo, a week at
Sorrento, and a fortnight at Rome, in which to
win the Titian from the Marchese degli Abbraccioli,
by baccarat if possible, or by banknotes
should fortune prove unkind. It was
the simplest thing in the world, and he would
avoid the remainder of the wet weather and
be back for the opening of Longchamp. And
Monsieur Michel rubbed his hands and said
"Ter-rès bien!" again, with much emphasis.</p>

<p>When, a week later, Arsène was informed of
Monsieur's intention to leave him in sole
charge of his apartment for a time, he received
the intelligence with the dignified composure
of one who feels himself worthy of the confidence
reposed in him. The cook was to have
the vacation for which she had been clamoring,
that she might display to her relatives in Lille
the elaborate wardrobe which was the result
of her savings during three years in Monsieur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>Michel's employ. Perfectly. And the apartment
was to be aired and dusted daily, as if
monsieur himself were there. And visitors to
be told that monsieur was returning in a month.
And letters to be made to follow monsieur, to
Monte Carlo at first, and then to Rome. But
perfectly; it was completely understood. Arsène
bowed a number of times in succession,
and outwardly was as calm as a tall, candid-faced
clock, being wound up to run for a specified
time independent of supervision. But beneath
that smooth and carefully oiled expanse
of jet-black hair a whole colony of the most
fantastic ideas suddenly aroused themselves
and began to elbow each other about in a veritable
tumult.</p>

<p>Monsieur Michel took his departure in a
whirl of confusion, losing a quantity of indispensable
articles with exclamations of despair,
and finding them the next moment with cries
of satisfaction. Eugénie, the cook, compactly
laced into a traveling dress of blue silk, stood
at the doorway to bid her master good-by, and
was run into at each instant by the cabman or
the concierge or Monsieur Michel himself, each
of whom covered, at top speed, several kilometres
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>of stair and hallway, in the stupendous
task of transferring a trunk, a valise, a hat-box,
a shawl-strap, and an umbrella from the
apartment to the carriage below. On the surface
of this uproar, the presence of Arsène
swam as serenely as a swan on a maelstrom.
He accompanied his master to the gare de
Lyon, and the last object which met the anxious
eyes of Monsieur Michel, peering out
from one of the first-class carriages of the departing
express, was his new servant, standing
upon the platform, as unmoved by the events
of the morning as if monsieur had been passing
from the dining room to take coffee in the
salon instead of from Paris to take breakfast
in Marseille. The sight of him was intensely
soothing to the fevered spirit of Monsieur Michel,
on whom the details of such a departure
produced much the same effect as do cakes of
soap when tossed into the mouth of an active
geyser.</p>

<p>"He is calm," he said to himself, rubbing
his hands. "He is very calm, and he will not
lose his head while I am gone. Ter-rès
bien!"</p>

<p>But the calm of Arsène was the calm of thin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>ice over swiftly rushing waters. As the polished
buffers of the last carriage swung out of
sight around the curve with a curiously furtive
effect, like the eyes of an alarmed animal, slipping
backward into its burrow, he clenched the
fingers of his right hand, and slipping his
thumb nail under the edge of his upper teeth,
drew it forward with a sharp click. At the
same time he said something to his vanished
master in the second person singular, which is
far from being the address of affection on the
lips of a valet-maître d'hôtel.</p>

<p>Wheeling suddenly after this singular manifestation,
Monsieur Sigard found himself the
object of close and seemingly amused scrutiny
on the part of an individual standing directly
behind him. There was something so extremely
disconcerting in this gentleman's unexpected
proximity, and in his very evident
enjoyment of the situation, that Arsène was
upon the point of turning abruptly away, when
the other addressed him, speaking the colloquial
French of their class, with the slightest
possible hint of foreign accent.</p>

<p>"Bah, vieux! Is it that I do not know what
they are, the patrons? Oh, lalà!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<p>"Avec ça! There are some who have it, an
astounding audacity!" said Arsène to the air
over the stranger's head.</p>

<p>"Farceur!" replied the stranger, to the air
over Arsène's. And then&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are two parrakeets that have need
of plucking across the way," he added, reflectively.</p>

<p>"There are two empty sacks here to put the
feathers in," answered Arsène, with alacrity;
and ten minutes later, oblivious to the chill
damp of the March morning, Monsieur Sigard
and his new-found acquaintance, seated at a
little table in front of a near-by wine-shop,
were preparing in company the smoky-green
mixture of absinthe and water which Paris
slang has dubbed a parrakeet. On the part of
Arsène the operation was performed with elaborate
solicitude, and as he poured a tiny stream
of water over the lump of sugar on the flat
spoon balanced deftly across the glass, he held
his head tipped sidewise and his left eye closed,
in the manner of a contemplative fowl, and was
oblivious to all but the delectable business of
the moment.</p>

<p>But his companion, while apparently deeply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>engaged in the preparation of his own beverage,
was far from being wholly preoccupied
thereby. He was a man shorter by an inch or
two than Monsieur Michel's maître d'hôtel,
dressed in the most inconspicuous fashion, and
with an air of avoiding any emphasis of voice
or gesture which would be apt to attract more
than casual attention to the circumstance of
his existence. There was something about him
vaguely suggestive of a chameleon, an instant
harmonizing of his appearance and manner
with any background whatsoever against which
he chanced to find himself placed, and a curious
clouding of his eyes when unexpectedly
they were met by those of another, which lent
him an immediate air of profound stupidity.
No doubt his long practice in this habit of
self-obliteration made him doubly appreciative
of Arsène's little outburst of ill-feeling on the
platform of the gare de Lyon. A man who
would do that in public&mdash;well, he had much
to learn!</p>

<p>Just now, however, this gentleman's eyes
were very bright, though they had dwindled to
mere slits; and he followed every movement of
the unconscious Arsène with short, swift glances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>from beneath his drooping lids, as, bit by bit,
the lumps of sugar melted under the steady
drip of the trickling water, and the opalescent
mixture mounted toward the brims. He knew
but two varieties of absinthe drinker, this observant
individual,&mdash;the one who progressed,
under its influence, from cheerful candor to
shrewdest insight into the motives of others,
and most skilful evasion of their toils; the
other whom, by easy stages, it led from obstinate
reserve to the extreme of careless garrulity.
At this moment he was on the alert for
symptoms.</p>

<p>Arsène looked up suddenly as the last morsel
of his sugar melted, and, lifting his glass,
dipped it before the eyes of his new friend.</p>

<p>"To your health,&mdash;Monsieur&mdash;?" he said,
in courteous interrogation.</p>

<p>"Fresque," said the other.</p>

<p>"Bon! And I, Monsieur Fresque, am Sigard,
Arsène Sigard, maître d'hôtel, at your
service, of the type who has just taken himself
off, down there."</p>

<p>And he indicated the imposing pile of the
gare de Lyon with his thumb, and then, closing
his eyes, took a long sip of his absinthe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>and replacing the glass upon the table, plunged
his hands into his pockets and stared off gloomily
toward the Seine.</p>

<p>"Poof!" he said, "but I am content that
he is gone. What a filthiness, a rich man&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Not to be denied," agreed Monsieur
Fresque. "There is not a foreign sou's worth
of delicacy in the whole lot!"</p>

<p>"Mazette! I believe thee," answered the
other, much pleased. Fresque's thin lips relaxed
the veriest trifle at the familiarity, and
he lit a cigarette and gazed vacantly into
space.</p>

<p>"But what dost thou expect?" he observed,
with calm philosophy.</p>

<p>It appeared that what Arsène expected was
that honest folk should not work from seven to
ten, in an ignoble box of a pantry, on boots,
and silver, and what not, he demanded of him,
name of a pipe! and dust, and sweep, and
serve at table, good heaven! and practice a
species of disgusting politeness to a type of
old engraving like Monsieur Armand Michel.
And all, oh, mon Dieu! for the crushing sum
of twenty dollars a month, did he comprehend?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>while the animal in question was sowing
his yellow buttons by fistfuls. Mazette!
Evidently, he himself was not an eagle. He
did not demand the Louvre to live in, for
example, nor the existence lalala of Emile
Loubet&mdash;what? but it was not amusing, he
assured him, to be in the employ of the great
revolting one in question. Ah, non!</p>

<p>"Eiffelesque!" succinctly commented Monsieur
Fresque.</p>

<p>But, said Arsène, there was another side to
the question, and he himself, it went without
saying, was no waffle-iron, speaking of stupidity.
He had not been present the day fools
were distributed. Oh, far from that! In consequence,
it was to become hump-backed with
mirth, that part of his life passed behind the
back of the example of an old Sophie whom
he had the honor to serve. He had not forgotten
how to juggle since he traveled with a
band of mountebanks. And there were the
patron's plates,&mdash;at one hundred francs the
piece, good blood! Also he smoked the ancient
cantaloupe's cigarettes, and as for the
wines&mdash;tchutt! Arsène kissed his finger-tips
and took a long sip of absinthe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>"He is gone for long?" inquired Fresque.</p>

<p>Ah, that! Who knew? Six weeks at least.
And meanwhile might not a brave lad amuse
himself in the empty apartment&mdash;eh? Oh, it
would be life in a gondola, name of a name of
a name!</p>

<p>The conversation was prolonged for an hour,
Arsène growing more and more confidential
under the seductive influence of his parrakeet,
and his companion showing himself so heartily
in accord with his spirit of license, that, by degrees,
he captured completely the fancy of the
volatile valet, and was permitted to take his
departure only on the condition of presenting
himself in the place Vendôme that evening
for the purpose of smoking the cantaloupe's
cigarettes and seeing Arsène juggle with the
hundred-franc plates.</p>

<p>Monsieur Fresque was as good as his word.
He put in an appearance promptly at eight
o'clock, hung his hat and coat, at his host's
invitation, on a Louis Quinze applique, and
made himself comfortable in a chaise longue
which&mdash;on the guarantee of Duveen&mdash;had
once belonged to the Pompadour. Arsène outdid
himself in juggling, and afterwards they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>cracked a bottle of Château Laffitte and drank
it with great satisfaction out of Salviati glasses,
topping off the entertainment with Russian
kümmel and two of Monsieur Michel's cigars.
Arsène, in his picturesque idiom, expressed
himself as being tapped in the eye with his
new friend to the extent of being able to quit
him no longer, and forthwith Monsieur Hercule
Fresque took up his quarters in the bedroom
of the cantaloupe, his host established himself
in Monsieur Michel's Empire guest chamber,
and the "life in a gondola" went forward for
five weeks to the supreme contentment of both
parties.</p>

<p>Now it is a peculiarity of life in a gondola, as
is known to all who have sampled its delights,
that, while it lasts, consideration of past and
future alike becomes dulled, and one loses all
sense of responsibility in the lethal torpor of
the present. So it was not until Arsène received
a letter from Monsieur Michel, announcing
his return, that he began to figure up the
possible consequences of his experiment. They
were, as he gloomily announced to Hercule,
stupefying to the extent of dashing out one's
brains against the wall. But one bottle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>Château Laffitte remained, and none whatever
of Russian kümmel. Moreover, the brocade
of the chaise longue was hopelessly ruined by
the boots of the conspirators, and the enthusiasm
of Arsène's juggling had reduced by fifty
per cent the set of Sèvres plates. What was
to be done, bon Dieu, what <em>was</em> to be done?</p>

<p>Monsieur Fresque, having carefully perused
a letter with an Italian stamp, which had come
by the evening mail, revolved the situation in
his mind, slowly smoking the last of the cantaloupe's
cigars, and glancing from time to
time at the despondent figure of his host, with
his eyes narrowed to mere slits. Had the fish
been sufficiently played? He reeled in a foot
or so of line by way of experiment.</p>

<p>"What, after all, is a situation?" he said.
"Thou wilt be discharged, yes. But afterwards?
Pah! thou wilt find another. And
thou hast thy rigolade."</p>

<p>"Ah, that!" replied Arsène with a shrug.
"I believe thee! But thinkest thou my old
melon will find himself in the way of glueing
the ribbon of the Légion on me for what I
have done? I see myself from here, playing
the harp on the bars of La Maz!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<p>"La vie à Mazas, c'est pas la vie en gondole,"
observed Hercule philosophically.</p>

<p>"Tu parles!"</p>

<p>Hercule appeared to take a sudden resolve.
He swung his feet to the floor, and bending
forward in the chaise longue, began to speak
rapidly and with extreme earnestness.</p>

<p>"Voyons, donc, mon gars, thou hast been
foolish, but one must not despair. What is
done in France is never known in Italy. And
here thou art surrounded by such treasures as
the imbeciles of foreigners pay fortunes for,
below there. Take what thou hast need of,&mdash;a
trunk of the patron's, some silver, what
thou canst lay hands on of gold and brass
and enamel, whatever will not break&mdash;and
get away before he returns. In Milan thou
canst sell it all, and get another place. I
have friends there, and thou shalt have letters.
Voilà!"</p>

<p>"But one must have money," replied Arsène,
brightening, nevertheless. "And that is lacking
me."</p>

<p>Hercule seemed to ponder this objection
deeply. Finally, with a sigh of resignation, he
spoke again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<p>"B'en, voilà! Thou hast been my friend, is
it not so? Hercule Fresque is not the man to
be ungrateful. I am poor, and have need of
my little savings&mdash;But, there! it is for a
friend&mdash;pas? Let us say no more!" And he
thrust a roll of banknotes into the hands of
the stupefied Arsène.</p>

<p>The evening was spent in arranging the details
of the flight. Arsène produced a serviceable
trunk from the storeroom, and in this the
two men placed a great variety of the treasures
which Monsieur Michel had accumulated
during twenty years of patient search and exorbitant
purchase. Squares of priceless tapestry,
jeweled watches and snuff boxes, figurines
of old Sèvres, ivories cunningly carved and
yellow with age, madonnas of box-wood, and
wax, and ebony,&mdash;all were carefully wrapped
in newspapers and stowed away; and to these
Arsène added a dozen of his master's shirts,
two suits of clothes, and a box of cigarettes.
But when all the available material had been
appropriated there yet remained an empty
space below the tray. It would never do to
have the treasures knocking about on the
way. Arsène proposed a blanket&mdash;or, better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>yet, one of Monsieur Michel's overcoats. But
Hercule, after rearranging the trunk so as to
make the empty space of different form, turned
suddenly to his companion, who was picking
nervously at his fingers and watching the so
fruitful source of suggestion with a pathetic
air of entreaty, and clapped him gleefully upon
the chest.</p>

<p>"A painting!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Complete demoralization seemed to have
taken possession of Arsène. He was very
pale, and his eyes constantly sought the salon
door as if he expected the object of his ingenious
epithets to burst in at any moment, with
the prefect and all his legions at his heels.</p>

<p>"A painting?" he repeated blankly; "but
how, a painting?"</p>

<p>But Monsieur Fresque had already mounted
nimbly on a chair and lifted the cherished Titian
of Monsieur Michel from its place against
the tapestry. There was no further need of
persuasion. The moment had come for action;
and, seizing a hammer, he began to
wrench off the frame, talking rapidly between
short gasps of exertion.</p>

<p>"But certainly, a painting. This one is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>small&mdash;ugh!&mdash;but who can say how valuable?
They sell readily down there, these black
daubs. Ah! By rolling, it will fill the empty
space, seest thou, and later it may mean a
thousand francs. One does not do things by&mdash;umph!&mdash;by
halves in such a case. Sacred
nails! One would say they had been driven
in for eternity! Oof! Thou art fortunate to
have me to advise thee, great imbecile. Mayhap
this is worth all the rest. Pig of a frame,
va! It is of iron. Ugh! He will be furious,
thy patron, but what of that? In Italy thou
wilt hear no more of it. Still one nail. Come
away, then, type of a cow! Enfin!"</p>

<p>With one final effort he tore off the last
fragment of frame, peeled the canvas from the
back-board, and, rolling it carefully, tucked it
into the empty space, replaced the tray, and
closed the trunk with a snap.</p>

<p>"Voilà!" he said, straightening himself and
turning a red but triumphant face to the astounded
maître d'hôtel.</p>

<p>"Now for the letters," he added, seating
himself at Monsieur Michel's desk and beginning
to scribble busily. "Do thou go for a
cab, and at a gallop. It has struck half past
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>ten and the Bâle rapide leaves the gare de l'Est
at midnight."</p>

<p>Hardly had the door of the apartment
closed upon the demoralized valet when Monsieur
Fresque hastily shoved to one side the
note he had begun, and, writing a sentence or
two upon another slip of paper, wrapped the
latter about a two-sou piece, and went quietly
to the salon window. Opening this cautiously,
he found a fine rain falling outside, and the
eastern half of the square deserted save for
two figures,&mdash;one the flying form of Arsène,
cutting across a corner into the rue Castiglione
in search of a cab, and the other that of
a man muffled in a heavy overcoat and with
a slouch hat pulled well over his eyes, who was
lounging against the railing of the Column,
and who, as Fresque opened the window, shook
himself into activity and stepped nimbly out
across the wide driveway. Hercule placed the
paper containing the two-sou piece upon the
window sill and with a sharp flick of his forefinger
sent it spinning down into the square.
The man in the slouch hat stooped for an instant
in passing the spot where it lay, and
Monsieur Fresque, softly closing the window,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>stretched his arms upward into a semblance
of a gigantic letter Y, and indulged in a prodigious
yawn.</p>

<p>"Ça y est!" said he.</p>

<p>Papa Briguette had long since climbed into
his high bedstead, in the loge de concierge,
when, for the second time in fifteen minutes,
he was aroused by the voice of Arsène calling,
"Cordon, s'il vous plaît!" in the main hallway,
and, reaching from under his feather coverlid,
pressed the bulb which unlocked the
street-door.</p>

<p>"Quel coureur, que ce gars!" grumbled
the worthy man to his fat spouse, snoring complacently
at his side. "I deceive myself if,
when Monsieur Michel returns, thou dost not
hear a different story."</p>

<p>"Awr-r-r-r!" replied Maman Briguette.</p>

<p>On the way to the gare de l'Est Arsène recovered
the better part of his lost composure,
and listened with something akin to cheerfulness
to the optimistic prognostications of his
companion. By the time the precious trunk
was registered and he had secured his seat in
a second-class compartment of the Bâle rapide,
he was once more in high feather and profuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>in expressions of gratitude, as he smoked a
farewell cigarette with Fresque while waiting
for the train to start.</p>

<p>"Thou canst believe me, mon vieux," he
protested. "It is not a little thing that thou
hast done, name of a name. Ah, non! It
was the act of a brave comrade, that I assure
thee. Et voyons! When I have sold the effects
down there, thou shalt have back thy little
paper mattress, word of honor! Yes, and
more&mdash;thy share of the gain, mon zig!"</p>

<p>He grasped the other's hand fervently as a
passing guard threw them a curt "En voiture,
messieurs!" and seemed on the point of kissing
him farewell. There was some confusion
attendant upon his entering the compartment,
owing to the excessive haste of a man muffled in
a heavy overcoat and with a slouch hat pulled
well over his eyes, who arrived at the last moment
and persisted in scrambling in, at the very
instant chosen by Monsieur Sigard. The latter
immediately reappeared at the window, and, as
the train began to move, shouted a few final
acknowledgments at his benefactor.</p>

<p>"B'en, au r'voir, vieux! And I will write
thee from below there, thou knowest. A thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>thanks. Fear not for thy blue paper&mdash;what?
Thou shalt have it back, sou for sou,
name of a name!"</p>

<p>He was almost out of hearing now, his face
a cream-colored splotch against the deep maroon
of the railway carriage, and, drawing out
a gaudy handkerchief, he waved it several
times in token of farewell.</p>

<p>"I shall never forget thee, never!" he cried,
as a kind of afterthought and valedictory in
one.</p>

<p>"Ah, ça!" said Monsieur Fresque to himself,
as Arsène's face went out of sight, "<em>that</em>
I well believe!"</p>

<p>Yet, so inconstant is man, the promised letter
from "below there" never reached him.
Another did, however, and it was this which
he might have been observed reading to a
friend, with every evidence of the liveliest satisfaction,
one week later, at a rear table before
the Taverne Royale. One would hardly have
recognized the plainly, almost shabbily dressed
comrade of Arsène, with his retiring manners
and his furtive eyes, in this extremely prosperous
individual, in polished top hat, white waistcoat
and gaiters, and gloves of lemon yellow.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>His companion was equally imposing in appearance,
and it was apparent that he derived
as much amusement from listening to Monsieur
Fresque's epistle as did the latter from
reading it aloud, which he did with the most
elaborate emphasis, calling the other's attention
to certain sentences by tapping him lightly
upon the arm and repeating them more slowly.</p>

<p>The letter was in Italian, and ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">

<span class="smcap">Milan</span>, <em>April 20, 1901</em>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My good Ercole</span>,&mdash;I am leaving here today
for Rome, where the case of the government
against the Marchese degli Abbraccioli
is to come on next week, but before I do so I
must write you of the last act in the little comedy
of Arsène Sigard. I never lost sight of
him from the moment we left Paris, and when
he found I was also on my way to Italy, he
became confidential, and, in exchange for certain
information which I was able to give him
about Milan, etc., told me a long story about
himself and his affairs, which I found none the
less amusing for knowing it to be a tissue of
lies. The time passed readily enough, but I
was relieved when we started over the St. Gothard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>because I knew then that the game was
as good as played. We arrived at Chiasso on
time (two o'clock) and I found Sassevero on the
platform when I jumped out. He had come
on from Rome the night before, and was in
a positive panic because Palmi, who had been
watching old Michel there, had lost him somehow
and nobody knew where he'd gone. He
might have come through on any train, of
course, and Sassevero didn't even know him
by sight.</p>

<p>Naturally, our little business with Sigard
was soon done. Cagliacci is still chief of customs
at Chiasso, and he simply confiscated the
trunk and everything in it, though, of course,
the government wasn't after anything but the
picture. There were two hours of argument
over the disposition of Sigard, but it seemed
best to let him go and nothing further said,
which he was only too glad to do. The Old
Man is shy of diplomatic complications, it appears,
and he had told Sassevero to frighten
the chap thoroughly and then let him slip off.</p>

<p>Here comes in the most remarkable part of
all. Just as Sigard was marching out of the
room, in came the Lucerne express, and our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>friend walks almost into the arms of an oldish
gentleman who had jumped out of a carriage
and was hurrying into the customs room.</p>

<p>"Bon Dieu!" said this individual, "what
does <em>this</em> mean?"</p>

<p>"What does what mean?" put in Sassevero
like a flash, and the other was so taken by surprise
that, before he had time to think what he
was saying, the secret was out.</p>

<p>"That's my valet de chambre!" he said.</p>

<p>"Really?" said Sassevero. "Bravo! Then
you're the gentleman with the Marchese degli
Abbraccioli's second Titian in the false bottom
of his trunk!"</p>

<p>Could anything have been more exquisite?
The old chap is out some hundred thousand
lire on the transaction, because, of course,
Cagliacci confiscated it like the other. It was
a sight to remember,&mdash;the two pictures side
by side in his room, and Michel and Sigard
cursing each other above them! We all went
on to Milan by the next train, except Sigard,
who did the prudent thing on the appearance
of his padrone, and disappeared, but Michel's
appeal to the French consulate was of no
effect. The consul told him flat that he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>going directly against the law in trying to get
old works of art over the frontier, and that he
couldn't plead ignorance after the detail of
the false bottom.</p>

<p>Sassevero says the Old Man is immensely
pleased with the way you handled your end of
the affair. The funny part of it is that Sigard
apparently hadn't the most remote suspicion
of your being in any way involved in his catastrophe.</p>

<p class="right">
Your most devoted,</p>
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Cavaletto</span>.

<h2><a id="Little_Tapin"></a>Little Tapin</h2>

<p class="dropcap">HIS name was Jean-Marie-Michel Jumière,
and the first eighteen years of his
life were spent near the little Breton village
of Plougastel. They were years of which
each was, in every respect, like that which went
before, and, in every respect, like that which
followed after: years, that is to say, devoid of
incident, beyond the annual pardon, when the
peasants came from far and near to the quaint
little church, to offer their prayers at the cemetery
Calvary, and display their holiday costumes,
and make love, and exchange gossip on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>the turf round about. It is a land of wide
and wind-swept hillsides, this, imbued with the
strange melancholy of a wild and merciless
sea, and wherein there are no barriers of convention
or artificiality between earth and sky,
man and his Maker; but Jean-Marie loved it
for its very bleakness. From the doorway of
his mother's cottage, standing, primly white, in
the midst of great rocks and strawberry fields,
with its thatched roof drawn down, like a hood,
about its ears, as if in protection against the
western gales, he could look out across the
broad harbor of Brest to the Goulet, the gateway
to that great Atlantic whose mighty voice
came to his ears in stormy weather, muttering
against the barrier of the shore. And this
voice of the sea spoke to Jean-Marie of many
things, but, most of all, of the navies of France,
of the mighty battleships which went out from
Brest to unimagined lands, far distant, China,
America, and the southern islands, whence
comrades, older than himself, brought back
curious treasures, coral, and shells, and coins,
and even parrots, to surprise the good people
of Plougastel. He looked at them enviously, as
they gathered about the door of Père Yvetot's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>wine-shop, when they were home on leave, and
spun sailor yarns for his delighted ears. How
wonderful they were, these men who had seen
the world,&mdash;Toulon, and Marseille, and Tonkin,&mdash;how
wonderful, with their wide, flapping
trousers, and their jaunty caps, with a white
strap and a red pompon, and their throats and
breasts, showing ruddy bronze at the necks of
their shirts!</p>

<p>At such times Jean-Marie would join timidly
in the talk, and, perhaps, speak of the time
when he, too, should be marin français, and
see the world. And the big Breton sailors
would laugh good-naturedly, and slap him on
the shoulder, and say: "Tiens! And how
then shall the cruisers find their way into Brest
harbor, when the little phare is gone?" For
it was a famous joke in Plougastel to pretend
that Jean-Marie, with his flaming red hair, was
a lighthouse, which could be seen through the
Goulet, far, far out at sea.</p>

<p>But Jean-Marie only smiled quietly in reply,
for he knew that his day would come. At
night, the west wind, sweeping in from the Atlantic,
and rattling his little casement, seemed
to be calling him, and it was a fancy of his to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>answer its summons in a whisper, turning his
face toward the window.</p>

<p>"All in good time, my friend. All in good
time!"</p>

<p>Again, when he was working in the strawberry
fields, he would strain his eyes to catch
the outline of some big green battleship, anchored
off Brest, or, during one of his rare
visits to the town, lean upon the railing of the
pont tournant, to watch the sailors and marines
moving about the barracks and magazines on
the quais of the porte militaire. All in good
time, my friends; all in good time!</p>

<p>Only, there were two to whom one did not
speak of these things,&mdash;the Little Mother,
and Rosalie Vivieu. Already the sea had
taken three from Madame Jumière&mdash;Baptiste,
her husband, and Philippe and Yves, the older
boys, who went out together, with the fishing
fleet, seven years before, in the staunch little
smack La Belle Fortune. She had been cheerful,
even merry, during the long weeks of waiting
for the fleet's return, and, when it came in
one evening, with news of La Belle Fortune
cut down in the fog by a North Cape German
Lloyd, and all hands lost, she had taken the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>news as only a Breton woman can. Jean-Marie
was but twelve at the time, but there is
an intuition, beyond all reckoning in years, in
the heart of a fisher's son, and never should
he forget how the Little Mother had caught
him to her heart that night, at the doorway of
their cottage, crying, "Holy Saviour! Holy
Saviour!" with her patient blue eyes upturned
to the cold, grey sky of Finistère! As for
Rosalie, Jean-Marie could not remember when
they two had not been sweethearts, since the
day when, as a round-eyed boy of six, he had
watched Madame Vivieu crowding morsels of
blessed bread into her baby mouth at the pardon
of Plougastel, since all the world knows
that in such manner only can backwardness of
speech be cured. Rosalie was sixteen now, as
round, and pink, and sweet as one of her own
late peaches, and she had promised to marry
Jean-Marie some day. For the time being, he
was allowed to kiss her only on the great occasion
of the pardon, but that was once more
each year than any other gars in Plougastel
could do, so Jean-Marie was content. No, evidently,
to these two there must be no mention
of his dreamings of the wide and wonderful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>sea, of the summons of the impatient western
wind, of those long reveries upon the pont
tournant.</p>

<p>So Jean-Marie hugged his visions to his
heart for another year, working in the strawberry
fields, gazing out with longing eyes toward
the warships in the harbor, and whispering,
when the fingers of the wind tapped upon
his little casement: "All in good time, my
friend. All in good time!"</p>

<p>And his day came at last, as he had known
it would. But with what a difference! For
there were many for the navy that spring.
Plougastel had nine, and Daoulas fifteen ready,
and Hanvec seven, and Crozon twenty-one,
and from Landerneau, and Châteaulin, and
Lambezellec, and le Folgoet came fifty more,
and from Brest itself, a hundred; and all of
these, with few exceptions, were great, broad-shouldered
lads, strong of arm and deep of
chest, and so the few who were slender and
fragile, like Jean-Marie, were assigned to the
infantry, and sent, as is the custom, far from
Finistère, because, says the code, change of
scene prevents homesickness, and what the
code says must, of course, be true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>

<p>When Madame Jumière heard this she smiled
as she was seldom known to smile. The Holy
Virgin, then, had listened to her prayers. The
gars was to be a piou-piou instead of a col bleu,
after all! The great sea should not rob her
again, as it had robbed her in the time. It
was very well, oh, grace au saint Sauveur, it
was very well! And, all that night, the Little
Mother prayed, and watched a tiny taper, flickering
before her porcelain image of Notre
Dame de la Recouvrance, while Jean-Marie
tossed and turned upon his little garret bed,
and made no reply, even in a whisper, to the
west wind, rattling his casement with insistent
fingers.</p>

<p>But it was all far worse than he had pictured
it to himself, even in those first few hours of
disappointment and despair. The last Sunday
afternoon which he and Rosalie passed, hand
in hand, seated by the Calvary in Plougastel
cemetery, striving dumbly to realize that they
should see each other no more for three long
years; the following morning, chill and bleak
for that time of year, when he and the Little
Mother, standing on the platform of the station
at Brest, could barely see each others'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>faces, for the sea-fog and their own hot tears;
the shouts and laughter and noisy farewells
of the classe, crowding out of the windows of
their third-class carriages; and, finally, the interminable
journey to Paris,&mdash;all of these
were to Jean-Marie like the successive stages
of a feverish, uneasy dream. He knew none
of the noisy Breton peasant lads about him,
but sat by himself in the centre of the compartment,
too far from either window to catch
more than fleeting glimpses of the fog-wrapped
landscape through which the train crept at
thirty kilometres the hour. At long intervals,
they stopped in great stations, of which little
Jean-Marie remembered to have heard,&mdash;Morlaix,
St. Brieuc, Rennes, and Laval, where the
recruits bought cakes and bottles of cheap
wine, and joked with white-capped peasant
women on the platforms; and twice during the
long night he was roused from a fitful, troubled
sleep to a consciousness of raucous voices crying
"Le Mans!" and "Chartres!" and gasped
in sudden terror&mdash;before he could remember
where he was&mdash;at the faces of his slumbering
companions, ghastly and distorted in the
wretched light of the compartment lamp. So,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>as the dawn was breaking over Paris, they
came into the gare Montparnasse, and, too
drowsy to realize what was demanded of them,
were herded together by the drill sergeants in
charge, and marched away across the city to
the barracks of La Pépinière.</p>

<p>The weeks that followed were to Jean-Marie
hideous beyond any means of expression.
From the first he had been assigned to the
drum-corps, and spent hours daily, under command
of a corporal expert in the art, laboriously
learning double rolls and ruffles in the
fosse of the fortifications. For they are not in
the way of enduring martyrdom, the Parisians,
and even while they cry "Vive l'armée!" with
their hats off, and their eyes blazing, the drummers
and buglers are sent out of hearing, to
practice the music that later, when the regiments
parade, will stir the patriotism of the
throng.</p>

<p>But this part of his new life was no hardship
to Jean-Marie, or Little Tapin, as his comrades
soon learned to call him, because he was the
smallest drummer in the corps. On the contrary,
it was something to be in the open air,
even though that air was tainted with sluggish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>smoke from the factory chimneys of Levallois-Perret,
instead of being swept and refreshed by
the west wind from beyond the Goulet. And he
was very earnest, very anxious to please, was
Little Tapin. First of all the new drummers, he
learned the intricacies of the roll, and so diligently
did he improve the hours of practice
that he was first, as well, to be regularly assigned
to a place in the regimental band. No,
this was no hardship. What cramped and
crushed his kindly little heart, what clouded
his queer, quizzical eyes, was nothing less than
Paris, beautiful, careless Paris, that laughed,
and danced, and sang about him, and had
never a thought for Little Tapin, with his
funny, freckled face, and his ill-fitting uniform
of red and blue, and his coarse boots, and his
ineradicable Breton stare.</p>

<p>In Plougastel he had been wont to greet and
to be greeted, to hear cheery words from those
who passed him on the wide, white roads. He
was part of it all, one who was called by his
honest name, instead of by a ridiculous sobriquet,
and who had his share in all that went
forward, from the strawberry harvest to the
procession of the pardon. And if all this was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>but neighborly interest, at least there were two
to whom Jean-Marie meant more, and who
meant more to him.</p>

<p>But Paris,&mdash;Paris, with her throngs of
strange faces hurrying past, her brilliantly
lighted boulevards, her crowded cafés, her
swirl of traffic along avenues that one crossed
only at peril of one's life,&mdash;he was lost
amid her clamor and confusion as utterly as
a bubble in a whirlpool! The bitterest hours
of his new life were those of his leave, in
which, with a band of his fellows, he went
out of the great green gates of the caserne to
seek amusement. Amusement! They soon
lost Little Tapin, the others, for he was one
who did not drink, and who walked straight on
when they turned to speak to passing grisettes,
who clung to each others' arms, and looked
back, laughing at the sallies of the piou-pious.
He was not bon camarade. He seemed to
disapprove. So, presently, while he was staring
into a shop window, they would slip down a
side street, or into a tiny café, and Little Tapin
would find himself alone in the great city which
he dreaded.</p>

<p>He came to spending long hours of his leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>in the galleries of the Louvre, hastening past
row upon row of nude statues with startled
eyes, or making his way wearily from picture
to picture of the old Dutch masters, striving,
striving to understand. Then, footsore and
heartsick, he would creep out upon the pont
du Carrousel, and stand for half an afternoon,
with his elbows on the railing. Behind him, the
human tide swung back and forward from bank
to bank, the big omnibuses making the bridge
throb and sway under his feet. It was good,
that, like the rise and fall of his little boat on
the swells of the bras de Landerneau, when he
rowed up with a comrade to fish at the mouth
of the Elorn. And there was always the Seine,
whirling, brown and angry, under the arches of
the pont Royal beyond, on its way to the sea,
where were the great, green battleships. Little
Tapin strained his eyes in an attempt to follow
the river's long sweep to the left, toward the
distant towers of the Trocadéro, and then pictured
to himself how it would go on and on,
out into the good, green country, past hillsides
crowded with vineyards, and broad, flat meadows,
where the poplars stood, aligned like
soldiers, against the sky, until it broadened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>toward its end, running swifter and more joyously,
for now the wind had met it and was
crying, "Come! Come! The Sea! The Sea!"
as it was used to cry, rattling the casement of
his little room at Plougastel. Then two great
tears ran slowly down his freckled cheeks, and
dropped, unnoted, into the flying river, wherein
so many fall. Ah, what a baby he was, to be
sure, Little Tapin!</p>

<p>So three months went by, and then one
morning the news ran through La Pépinière
that the regiment was going to move. There
is no telling how such tidings get abroad, for
the pawns are not supposed to know what part
in the game they are to play. A loose-tongued
lieutenant, perhaps, and a sharp-eared ordonnance,
or a word between two commandants
overheard by the sentry in his box at the gates
of the caserne. Whatever the source of information,
certain it was that, six hours after the
colonel of the 107th of the line had received
his orders, his newest recruit could have told
you as much of them as was known to General
de Galliffet himself, in his office on the boulevard
St. Germain.</p>

<p>A more than usually friendly comrade confided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>the news to Little Tapin, exulting. The
regiment was to move&mdash;in three days, name
of God! Epatant&mdash;what? And, what was
more, they were to go to the south, to Grenoble,
whence one saw the Alpes Maritimes, with
snow upon them&mdash;snow upon them, did Tapin
comprehend?&mdash;and always! No matter whether
it was a Tuesday, or a Friday,&mdash;yes, or
even a Sunday! There was <em>always</em> snow!</p>

<p>No, Little Tapin could hardly comprehend.
He pondered dully upon this new development
of his fate all that afternoon, and then, suddenly,
while he was beating the staccato roll of
the retraite in the court of the caserne that
night, he understood! Why, it was to go further
away, this,&mdash;further away from Plougastel,
and the Little Mother, and Rosalie, to be
stationed in God knew what great town, crueller,
more crowded than even Paris herself!</p>

<p>All that night Little Tapin lay staring at the
ceiling of the big dortoir, while the comrades
breathed heavily around him. And, little by
little, the spirit of rebellion roused and stirred
in his simple Breton heart. For he hated
it all,&mdash;this army, this dreary, rigid routine,
this contemptuous comment of trim, sneering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>young lieutenants, with waxed mustaches, and
baggy red riding breeches, and immaculately
varnished boots. He hated his own uniform,
which another tapin had worn before him, and
which, in consequence, had never even had the
charm of freshness. He hated the bugles,
and the drums,&mdash;yes, and, more than all, the
tricolor, the flag of the great, cruel Republic
which had cooped him up in these desolate
barracks of La Pépinière, instead of sending
him with other Bretons out to the arms of the
blue sea! And, when gray morning crept
through the windows of the dortoir, there lay
upon the pallet of Little Tapin a deserter, in
spirit, at least, from the 107th of the line!</p>

<p>That day, for the third time since joining
the regiment, Little Tapin was detailed as
drummer to the guard at the Palais du Louvre.
He knew what <em>that</em> meant,&mdash;a long, insufferably
tiresome day, with nothing to do save to
idle about a doorway of the palace, opposite
the place du Palais Royal, watching the throng
of shoppers scurrying to and fro, and passing
in and out of the big magasins du Louvre. It
was only as sunset approached that the drummer
of the guard detail had any duty to perform.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>Then he marched, all alone, with his
drum slung on his hip, across the place du Carrousel,
and down the wide central promenade
of the Tuileries gardens, to the circular basin
at their western end, where, on pleasant afternoons,
the little Parisians&mdash;and some, too,
of larger growth&mdash;man&oelig;uvred their miniature
yachts, to the extreme vexation of the sluggish
gold-fish. There, standing motionless, like a
sketch by Edouard Detaille, he watched the
sun creep lower, lower, behind the arc de
l'Etoile, until it went out of sight, and then,
turning, he marched back, drumming sturdily,
to warn all who lingered in the gardens that
the gates were about to close.</p>

<p>But they were not good for Little Tapin, those
hours of idleness at the portals of the palace.
It is the second busiest and most densely
thronged spot in Paris, this: first the place de
l'Opéra, and then the place du Palais Royal.
And to Little Tapin's eyes, as he glanced up
and down the rue de Rivoli, the great city
seemed more careless, more cruel than ever,
and bit by bit the rebellious impulse born in
the dortoir grew stronger, more irresistible.
His Breton mind was slow to action, but, once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>set in a direction, it was obstinacy itself. He
took no heed of consequences. If he realized
at any stage of his meditation what the outcome
of desertion must inevitably be, it was
only to put the thought resolutely from him.
Capture, court-martial, imprisonment, they
were only names to him. What was real was
that he should see Plougastel again, sit hand
in hand with Rosalie, and refind his comrades,
the wide, sunlit harbor, and the impatient
western wind, for which his heart was aching.
What was false and unbearable was longer service
in an army that he loathed.</p>

<p>He arranged the details of escape in his
mind, as he sat apart from his comrades of the
guard, fingering the drum-cords. An hour's
leave upon the morrow&mdash;certainly the tambour-major
would grant him so much, if he
said it was to bid his sister good-by; then, a
change from his detested uniform to a cheap
civile in the shop of some second-hand dealer
in the Gobelins quarter; and, finally, a quick
dash to the gare Montparnasse, when he should
have learned the hour of his train, and so,
away to Finistère. It sounded extremely simple,
as all such plans do, when the wish is father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>to the thought, and in his calculations he
went no further than Plougastel. After that,
one would see. So the long afternoon stole
past.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock the lieutenant of the guard
touched Little Tapin upon the shoulder, and,
more by instinct than actual perception, he
sprang to his feet and saluted.</p>

<p>"Voyons, mon petit," said the officer, not
unkindly. "It is time thou wast off. Thou
knowest thy duty&mdash;eh? There is no need of
instructions?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ça me connait, mon lieutenant," answered
Little Tapin quaintly, and, presently,
he was striding away to his post, under the arc
de Triomphe, past the statues, and the flowerbeds,
and the dancing fountains, across the
rue des Tuileries, and so into the wide, central
promenade of the gardens beyond.</p>

<p>The old woman who sold cakes, and reglisse,
and balloons to the children, was putting up
the shutters of her little booth as he passed,
and two others were piling wooden chairs in
ungainly pyramids under the trees, though the
gardens were still full of people, hurrying north
and south on the transverse paths leading to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>the rue de Rivoli or to the quai and the pont
de Solférino. But, curiously enough, the open
space around the western basin was almost deserted
as Little Tapin took his position, facing
the great grille.</p>

<p>The mid-August afternoon had been oppressively
warm, and now a thin haze had risen
from the wet wood pavement of the place de
la Concorde, and hovered low, pink in the
light of the setting sun. Directly before Little
Tapin the obelisk raised its warning finger,
and beyond, the Champs Elysées, thickly
dotted with carriages, and half veiled by great
splotches of ruddy-yellow dust, swept away in
a long, upward curve toward the distant arc de
l'Etoile.</p>

<p>But of all this Little Tapin saw nothing.
He stood very still, with his back to the basin,
where the fat goldfish went to and fro like lazy
sentinels, on the watch for a possible belated
little boy, with a pocket full of crumbs. He
was still deep in his dream of Plougastel, so
deep that he could almost smell the salt breeze
rollicking in from the Goulet, and hear the
chapel bell sending the Angelus out over the
strawberry fields and the rock-dotted hillside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p>After a minute, something&mdash;a teamster's
shout, or the snap of a cocher's whip&mdash;roused
him, and he glanced around with the same half-sensation
of terror with which he had wakened
in the night to hear the guards shouting "Le
Mans!" and "Chartres!" Then the reality
came back to him with a rush, and he grumbled
to himself. Oh, it was all very well, the wonderful
French army, all very well if one could have
been a marshal or a general, or even a soldier
of the line in time of war. There was a chance
for glory, bon sang! But to be a drummer&mdash;a
drummer one metre seventy in height, with
flaming red hair and a freckled face&mdash;a drummer
who was called Little Tapin; and to have,
for one's most important duty, to drum the
loungers out of a public garden! No, evidently
he would desert.</p>

<p>"But why?" said a grave voice beside him.</p>

<p>Little Tapin was greatly startled. He had
not thought he was saying the words aloud.
And his fear increased when, on turning to see
who had spoken, he found himself looking into
the eyes of one who was evidently an officer,
though his uniform was unfamiliar. He was
plain-shaven and very short, almost as short,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>indeed, as Little Tapin himself, but about him
there was a something of dignity and command
which could not fail of its effect. He wore a
great black hat like a gendarme's, but without
trimming, and a blue coat with a white plastron,
the tails lined with scarlet, and the sleeves
ending in red and white cuffs. White breeches,
and knee-boots carefully polished, completed
the uniform, and from over his right shoulder
a broad band of crimson silk was drawn
tightly across his breast. A short sword hung
straight at his hip, and on his left breast were
three orders on red ribbons,&mdash;a great star,
with an eagle in the centre, backed by a sunburst
studded with brilliants; another eagle,
this one of white enamel, pendant from a jeweled
crown, and a smaller star of enameled
white and green, similar to the large one.</p>

<p>Little Tapin had barely mastered these details
when the other spoke again.</p>

<p>"Why art thou thinking to desert?" he said.</p>

<p>"Monsieur is an officer?" faltered the drummer,&mdash;"a
general, perhaps. Pardon, but I do
not know the uniform."</p>

<p>"A corporal, simply&mdash;a soldier of France,
like thyself. Be not afraid, my little one. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>thou sayest shall be held in confidence. Tell
me thy difficulties."</p>

<p>His voice was very kind, the kindest Little
Tapin had heard in three long months, and
suddenly the barrier of his Breton reserve gave
and broke. The nervous strain had been too
great. He must have sympathy and advice&mdash;yes,
even though it meant confiding in a stranger
and the possible discovery and failure of
his dearly cherished plans.</p>

<p>"A soldier of France!" he exclaimed, impulsively.
"Ah, monsieur, there you have all
my difficulty. What a thing it is to be a soldier
of France! And not even that, but a
drummer, a drummer who is called Little Tapin
because he is the smallest and weakest in
the corps. To be taken from home, from the
country he loves, from Brittany, and made to
serve among men who despise him, who laugh
at him, who avoid him in the hours of leave,
because he is not bon camarade. To wear a
uniform that has been already worn. To sleep
in a dormitory where there are bêtes funestes.
To have no friends. To know that he is not
to see Plougastel, and the sweetheart, and the
Little Mother for three years. Never to fight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>but, at best, to drum voyous out of a garden!
That, monsieur, is what it is to be a soldier of
France!"</p>

<p>There were tears in Little Tapin's eyes now,
but he was more angry than sad. The silence
of months was broken, and the hoarded resentment
and despair of his long martyrdom,
once given rein, were not to be checked a second
time. He threw back his narrow shoulders
defiantly, and said a hideous thing:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Conspuez l'armée française!"</p>

<p>There was an instant's pause, and then the
other leaned forward, and with one white-gloved
hand touched Little Tapin on the eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before them a great plain, sloping very gradually
upward in all directions, like a vast, shallow
amphitheatre, spread away in a long series
of low terraces to where, in the dim distance,
the peaks of a range of purple hills nicked and
notched a sky of palest turquoise. From where
they stood, upon a slight elevation, the details
of even the farthest slopes seemed singularly
clean-cut and distinct,&mdash;the groups of grey
willows; the poplars, standing stiffly in twos
and threes; the short silver reaches of a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>river, lying in the hollows where the land occasionally
dipped; at long intervals, a whitewashed
cottage, gleaming like a sail against
this sea of green; even, on the most distant
swell of all, a herd of ruddy cattle, moving
slowly up toward the crest,&mdash;each and all of
these, although in merest miniature, as clear
and vivid in form and color as if they had been
the careful creations of a Claude Lorrain.</p>

<p>Directly before the knoll upon which they
were stationed, a wide road, dazzling white in
the sunlight, swept in a superb full curve from
left to right, and on its further side the ground
was covered with close-cropped turf, and completely
empty for a distance of two hundred
metres. But beyond! Beyond, every hectare
of the great semicircle was occupied by dense
masses of cavalry, infantry, and artillery, regiment
upon regiment, division upon division,
corps upon corps, an innumerable multitude,
motionless, as if carved out of many-colored
marbles!</p>

<p>In some curious, unaccountable fashion, Little
Tapin seemed to know all these by name.
There, to the left, were the chasseurs à pied,
their huge bearskins flecked with red and green
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>pompons, and their white cross-belts slashed
like capital X's against the blue of their tunics;
there, beside them, the foot artillery, a long
row of metal collar plates, like dots of gold,
and gold trappings against dark blue; to the
right, the Garde Royale Hollandaise, in brilliant
crimson and white; in the centre, the
infantry of the Guard, with tall, straight pompons,
red above white, and square black shakos,
trimmed with scarlet cord.</p>

<p>Close at hand, surrounding Little Tapin
and his companion, were the most brilliant
figures of the scene, and these, too, he seemed
to know by name. None was missing. Prince
Murat, in a cream-white uniform blazing with
gold embroidery, and with a scarlet ribbon
across his breast; a group of marshals, Ney,
Oudinot, Duroc, Macdonald, Augereau, and
Soult, with their yellow sashes, and cocked
hats laced with gold; a score of generals, Larouche,
Durosnel, Marmont, Letort, Henrion,
Chasteller, and the rest, with white instead of
gold upon their hats,&mdash;clean-shaven, severe
of brow and lip-line, they stood without movement,
their gauntleted hands upon their sword-hilts,
gazing straight before them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p>Little Tapin drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>Suddenly from somewhere came a short,
sharp bugle note, and instantly the air was full
of the sound of hoofs, and the ring of scabbards
and stirrup-irons, and the wide white road
before them alive with flying cavalry. Squadron
after squadron, they thundered by: mounted
chasseurs, with pendants of orange-colored
cloth fluttering from their shakos, and plaits of
powdered hair bobbing at their cheeks; Polish
light horse, with metal sunbursts gleaming on
their square-topped helmets, and crimson and
white pennons snapping in the wind at the
points of their lances; Old Guard cavalry,
with curving helmets like Roman legionaries;
Mamelukes, with full red trousers, white and
scarlet turbans, strange standards of horsehair
surmounted by the imperial eagle, brazen stirrups
singularly fashioned, and horse trappings
of silver with flying crimson tassels; Horse
Chasseurs of the Guard, in hussar tunics and
yellow breeches, their sabretaches swinging as
they rode; and Red Lancers, in gay uniforms
of green and scarlet. Like a whirlwind they
went past,&mdash;each squadron, in turn, wheeling
to the left, and coming to a halt in the open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>space beyond the road, until the last lancer
swept by.</p>

<p>A thick cloud of white dust, stirred into being
by the flying horses, now hung between the
army and the knoll, and through this one saw
dimly the mounted band of the 20th Chasseurs,
on gray stallions, occupying the centre
of the line, and heard, what before had been
drowned by the thunder of hoofs, the strains
of "Partant pour la Syrie."</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly, the dust cloud thinned and
lifted, so slowly that it seemed as if it would
never wholly clear. But, on a sudden, a sharp
puff of wind sent it whirling off in arabesques
to the left, and the whole plain lay revealed.</p>

<p>"Bon Dieu!" said Little Tapin.</p>

<p>The first rank of cavalry was stationed within
a metre of the further border of the road, the
line sweeping off to the left and right until details
became indistinguishable. And beyond,
reaching away in a solid mass, the vast host
dwindled and dwindled, back to where the
ascending slopes were broken by the distant
willows and the reaches of the silver stream.
With snowy white of breeches and plastrons,
with lustre of scarlet velvet and gold lace, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>sparkle of helmet and cuirass, and dull black
of bearskin and smoothly groomed flanks, the
army blazed and glowed in the golden sunlight
like a mosaic of a hundred thousand jewels.
Silent, expectant, the legions flashed crimson,
emerald, and sapphire, rolling away in broad
swells of light and color, motionless save for a
long, slow heave, as of the ocean, lying, vividly
iridescent, under the last rays of the setting
sun. Then, without warning, as if the touch
of a magician's wand had roused the multitude
to life, a myriad sabres swept twinkling from
their scabbards, and, by tens of thousands, the
guns of the infantry snapped with a sharp click
to a present arms. The bugles sounded all
along the line, the tricolors dipped until their
golden fringes almost swept the ground, the
troopers stood upright in their stirrups, their
heads thrown back, their bronzed faces turned
toward the knoll, their eyes blazing. And from
the farthest slopes inward, like thunder that
growls afar, and, coming nearer, swells into
unbearable volume, a hoarse cry ran down the
massed battalions and broke in a stupendous
roar upon the shuddering air,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vive l'empereur!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Little Tapin rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>"I am ill," he murmured. "I have been
faint. I seemed to see"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou hast seen," said the voice of his
companion, very softly, very solemnly,&mdash;"thou
hast seen simply what it is to be a soldier of
France!"</p>

<p>His hand rested an instant on the drummer's
shoulder, with the ghost of a caress.</p>

<p>"My little one," he added, tenderly, "forget
not this. It matters nothing whether one is
Emperor of the French or the smallest drummer
of the corps, whom men call 'Little Tapin.'
I, too, was called 'little' in the time&mdash;'The
Little Corporal' they called me, from
Moscow to the Loire. But it is all the same.
Chief of the army, drummer of the corps, on
the field of battle, in the gardens of the Tuileries,
routing the Prussians, or drumming out
the voyous,&mdash;it is all the same, my little one,
it is all the same. All that is necessary is to
understand&mdash;to understand that it is all and
always for la belle France. Empire or republic,
in peace or war&mdash;what difference? It is
still France, still the tricolor, still l'armée française."</p>

He lifted his hat, and looked steadily up at
the sky, where the first stars were shouldering
their way into view.</p>

<p>"Vive la France!" he added. And on his
lips the phrase was like a prayer.</p>

<p>Through the arc de l'Etoile the fading sunset
looked back, as upon something it was
loath to leave. Then Little Tapin flung back
his head. There was a strange, new light in
his eyes, and his breath came quickly, between
parted lips. Without a word he swung upon
his heels, slipped his drum into place, and
marched steadily away, beating the long roll.
Once, when he had gone a hundred metres, he
looked back. The figure of the Little Corporal
was still standing beside the basin, but now
it was very thin and faint, like the dust clouds
on the Champs Elysées. But, as the little
drummer turned, it raised one hand to its forehead
in salute.</p>

<p>Little Tapin stood motionless for an instant,
and then he smiled, and, through the deepening
twilight&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vive l'armée!" he shouted, shrilly. "Vive
la France!"</p>
